<Cale> Conduit is gnarly even if you're not new to Haskell -- I still find it
       annoyingly complicated, and I've been programming in Haskell for ~15
       years now. I feel like conduit and pipes are doing something which is
       just barely reasonable with Haskell's type system. It would be
       interesting to see whether it could be made any more straightforward
       in, say, Idris. There might be some way to use a little type-level com
                                                                        [21:01]
<Cale> putation to reduce the number of type parameters needed everywhere.

<Cale> Also, Idris has some nice customizable error reporting which was used
       to make the type errors involved with session types more
       comprehensible, and that seems like it could work well.

<emmanuel_erc> emamnuel is going to get better
<oldmanmike> Can you simulate linear types with dependent types?
<boj_> Cale: are lack of dependent types what you feel make it complicated?
<emmanuel_erc> Oops did not mean to write that
<Cale> boj_: Not exactly... there isn't a lot of type level computation going
       on in Conduit and Pipes as it stands, just lots of type parameters
                                                                        [21:03]

    My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…
<Cale> boj_: Maybe it would be nice to pack those collections of types into
       records so that their meaning wasn't just determined by position, and
       so that sometimes you could get away without writing them all out.
*** rodlogic (~rodlogic@179.159.96.218) has quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
                                                                        [21:05]
<boj_> Cale: agreed
<Cale> That seems like something you could almost do in GHC Haskell's type
       system, but I don't know how extensively anyone's tried it
<oldmanmike> My problem with Conduit is that it lets you into thinking it's
             something it isn't. You hear names like "conduit" and "pipe" and
             you think "Oh, I can structure my code in a data flow manner by
             having a series of pipes"  [21:06]
<oldmanmike> But that's not how it works
<Cale> Well, it's certainly not entirely unrelated to dataflow  [21:07]
<oldmanmike> I can T-split real world pipes and have branching, conduits are
             unawared of the concept of branching
<oldmanmike> I'm assuming because they're stream fused  [21:08]
<boj_> oldmanmike: have you looked at arrows?
<oldmanmike> On Typeclassopedia and some brief run-ins with FRP libraries, but
             I've never written anything with them
<Cale> oldmanmike: Certainly the more of that kind of operation you want to
       support, the more of a mess it becomes getting things to perform at
       runtime.
<boj_> i was looking at some frp library or another which used arrows last
       month, was an interesting exercise
<boj_> i have way too much code to refactor into frp though, so hung it up
                                                                        [21:09]
<oldmanmike> Oh, question kinda sorta related to FRP:  [21:10]
<Cale> oldmanmike: A few years ago, I was working on an arrow-ish FRP system
       we were using for an action RPG's game engine, and it did lots of
       runtime simplification of the dataflow graph -- unfortunately while the
       optimisations helped tremendously once done, you also had to pay
       up-front costs for them, and it was hard to get the balance to be worth
       the effort involved.
<boj_> Cale: what kind of up-front costs?  [21:11]
<oldmanmike> If I want to version a immutable data structure as I transform
             it, what would be the best way to do that, to basically keep
             track of snapshots of it? Just store each intermediate form in a
             list or something?
<boj_> if it requires concurrent access STM primitives  [21:12]
<Cale> boj_: Actually manipulating this typed heterogeneous graph of FRP
       combinators (things like holds and switches and stuff, if those mean
       anything to you), as well as operations which manipulated various
       nestings of pairs  [21:13]

    channel #haskell-beginners
<boj_> Cale: i was glancing at yampa, so kind of get it  [21:14]
<Cale> boj_: Our modified Arrow class had things like  assocR :: ((a,b),c) ~>
       (a,(b,c)) and its inverse, and swap :: (a,b) ~> (b,a) as well as things
       like unitL :: a ~> ((),a) and retractL :: ((),a) ~> a and such  [21:15]
<Cale> boj_: rather than requiring you to rely on 'arr' for all such things
<Cale> and so because they could be explicit, we could work out where the data
       was going between the real operations being done, and simplify that,
       removing all the tupling and untupling  [21:16]
<boj_> hmm, interesting.  did you stick with that solution?
*** jarshwah (~jarshwah@django/committer/jarshwah) has quit: Ping timeout: 240
    seconds  [21:17]
<Cale> Up until we ran out of funding -- the game engine ended up working
       reasonably well, though it would have needed even more work to run well
       on some of the phones we'd originally wanted to target
<boj_> ok, you indirectly answered my next question as well :)
*** jarshwah_ (~jarshwah@django/committer/jarshwah) has quit: Ping timeout:
    245 seconds
<Cale> That simplification of tuple operations, along with the custom Arrow
       class made the game run 6x faster :D  [21:18]
<Cale> and that was before all the other optimisations that it exposed
<boj_> that wasn't Keera Studios was it?
<Cale> nope
<Cale> iPwn Studios
<boj_> ok, they had an interesting performance boost story for their mobile
       game as well  [21:19]
<Cale> But yeah, I was really pleased that just stealing the definition of a
       symmetric monoidal category and following that more closely to the
       letter ended up having real-world performance gains :D
<boj_> "symmetric monoidal"  [21:20]

<Cale> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category
<Cale> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category
<boj_> these haskell channels make me google so many things
<Cale> Well, heh, it's really just enrichment -- everything we did could be
       understood on its own terms without knowing any category theory, but it
       turns out the category theorists had a design we could steal :)  [21:22]
<boj_> what are the properties of this that gave such a performance boost?
<Cale> boj_: Well, okay, the main thing that Arrow has going for it above
       Monad is that when you combine computations using (>>=), the thing on
       the right of (>>=) is a function.  [21:23]
<Cale> Functions are black boxes effectively
<Cale> You can only determine stuff about what function you have by applying
       it  [21:24]
<Cale> and of course, in a definition of (>>=), you tend not to have anything
       to apply the function to until you've already run the computation on
       the left
<Cale> Contrast this with Arrow, where the arguments to (>>>) are both of a
       type that you have some control over
*** potatoe (~nonex8@118.200.124.239) has quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
                                                                        [21:25]
<Cale> Which means that perhaps (>>>) gets to be clever, and simplify the
       first computation before anything runs, based on what's going to happen
       to its result
<Cale> However, arr spoils this  [21:26]
*** jay6981 (~Adium@2601:646:8d01:7f7d:1df4:5303:65a7:a565) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<Cale> Basically, every occurrence of 'arr' is a black box again, and your
       clever implementation of (>>>) doesn't get to simplify across any
       occurrence of it, because it can't tell what the function is.
*** dsh (~daishi@168.235.134.165) has quit: Quit: Leaving  [21:27]
<Cale> But the design of the Arrow class, and the subsequent translation of
       the proc/do Arrow notation relies heavily on arr applied to functions
       which manipulate tuples of results
<Cale> Most uses of arr are actually unnecessary if you throw in some extra
       primitive operations which rearrange nested pairs in various ways.
                                                                        [21:28]
<Cale> and the primitives we used are straight out of the definition of a
       symmetric monoidal category
<Cale> (The associator in both directions, and the left and right unitors,
       again in both directions)  [21:29]
<boj_> if i understand correctly then, you gain performance by removing the
       blackbox ambiguity?
<Cale> yep
<boj_> that is pretty cool, thanks for the explanation
<Cale> and then (>>>) gets to be clever and wire results directly to where
       they're going rather than letting these operations *actually*
       manipulate pairs  [21:30]
<Cale> and then more, you can actually start deleting parts of the computation
       altogether when you see that things go unused  [21:31]
<Cale> It's really cool, but it was also extremely complicated -- it was like
       8000 lines of the densest Haskell code I've ever worked on. :D  [21:32]
<boj_> i bet :D

<boj_> Cale: it's a terrible reason, and someone more experienced than myself
       can probably look past the cover
<Cale> Yeah, reflex is general purpose, reflex-dom is specifically for
       building web applications, but it can also be used to make webkit GUIs.
                                                                        [22:21]
<Cale> (You just compile the same program with GHC rather than GHCJS and it
       becomes a desktop application instead)
<Lokathor> Cale, so reflex can be used for non-graphical programs?  [22:22]
<Cale> yes
<Lokathor> such as a FRP web-server?
<Cale> Sure, though we don't have one yet
<Cale> It's something we definitely want to do
<Lokathor> that is, i'm interested setting up a multiplayer webserver (via
           websockets), and part of the internal state of the program will be
           calculated via FRP perhaps  [22:23]
<Lokathor> at least, that's my current idea. i've never looked into FRP
           really, so i have to sit down with it some time soon
<Lokathor> sadly, reflex isn't in stackage itself at the moment, so i'll have
           to setup a real project instead of just thinkering a bit  [22:26]
<Cale> At present, we've pretty much only been using FRP in the frontend of
       our web applications, and the backends have been really pretty simple
       things with a handful of APIs which handle requests to add new things
       to the DB for the most part and some websockets which notify the
       clients of changes to data -- so on the client side we have a bunch of
       (Dynamic t (Map (Id Foo) Foo))  things which basically embody the 
<Cale> part of the database that user is allowed to see.
<Lokathor> hmm  [22:27]

<Cale> But for a game, a lot of the complicated game logic would want to be in
       the backend
<Lokathor> Cale, are you familiar with Idle Games?
<Cale> So yeah, using FRP somehow there probably makes a lot of sense
<Cale> yeah  [22:28]
<Lokathor> it seemed like FRP would be a good fit for that type of game

<Cale> Well, for something that is mostly singleplayer, you could really do
       that almost entirely in the frontend
<Cale> It depends on how much interaction between players is happening
<Lokathor> well, a friend and i have a website with a websocket backend thing
           connecting things up. right now we just use it for a group code
           editor thing  [22:29]
<Lokathor> https://cosban.net/code?r=4900534569
<Lokathor> but we thought that some sort of "multiplayer idle game" would be
           both silly, and also get us to learn a little more about things
                                                                        [22:30]

<Roelof> kadoban:  no luck . I have now this : arith f x y = (f (fromInteger
         x))+ fromInteger y    and still this error message :  Could not
         deduce (a ~ Integer)     from the context (Num b)
<kadoban> Roelof: What does that message mean to you?  [02:55]
<Roelof> That I somehow must tell that a which is the argument to f must be a
         Integer   [02:56]
<kadoban> Roelof: That would be one solution, but since that would change the
          entire type of the function, and since the type has apparently been
          specified for you, that doesn't sound so good.  [02:57]
<Roelof> oke, that is why I hit the wall again and again 
<Roelof> Am I right that this (a -> b) -> Integer  mean there a function which
         takes a "a" as input and returns a b which is a Integer ??   [02:59]
<Lokathor> not correct
<kadoban> Roelof: You have the following puzzle-pieces: f :: (a -> b), x ::
          Integer, y :: a, fromInteger :: Num b => Integer -> b
<kadoban> Roelof: No, not at all.
<Lokathor> Roelof, "(a -> b) -> Integer" means a function that takes a
           function from a to b, and then retuns an Integer.
<Lokathor> note the parens. "(a -> b) -> Integer" is very different from "a ->
           b -> Integer"  [03:00]
<Roelof> ??? so I cannot say because b is the return type that type "b" is a
         Integer ??
<Lokathor> uh, well no?  [03:01]
<kadoban> Roelof: No. I'm not sure how you're reading that that would imply
          you could :-/
<Lokathor> if b were always Integer, it would just say Integer instead of b
<Roelof> yep, that is why this is confusing me   [03:03]
*** baweaver (~baweaver@c-76-102-155-45.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has quit: Remote

<Roelof> How can the returnt type of the function be of type "b" and later on
         it is a Integer   [03:04]
<kadoban> Roelof: Maybe if you spell out in detail what you think the type of
          this function is that'll help us pinpoint where you're going wrong?
<Roelof> or does the function have 2 arguments "a" and "b" and a return type
         of Integer 
<Roelof> (a -> b) means for me a function which takes a "a" and returns a "b" 
                                                                        [03:05]
<kadoban> Roelof: arith takes 3 arguments, the first one is a function, from a
          to b. The second argument to arith is an Integer. The third argument
          to arith is a value of type a

<Lokathor> Roelof, if you include the parenthesis like that, "(a -> b) ->
           Integer" means a function that takes another function (1 argument),
           and returns an Integer. Now, since it doesn't have an 'a' value, it
           can't use the function at all, it will just always return the same
           Integer

          think of it like a puzzle. I mentioned most of the pieces you're
          "given" as arguments to the function above. Your job is basically to
          end up with something of type "b" without totally ignoring any of
          the pieces.

<kadoban> If you can't get it, that's fine. Not every exercise is going to be
          easy immediately. I'd think there's easier exercises in the same
          vein earlier on, but I don't have the book to suggest any that are
          similar :-/  [03:34]
<Roelof> I try it now in pieces. First try to make a function that returns a
         Integer   [03:35]
<Roelof> There were some exercises before it which looks simular and I solve
         that one . This one is difficult because of the (a->b) -> Integer
         part   [03:37]

<prati> @let data SimpleFuncType = SimpleFuncType(String -> String) 
<lambdabot>  Defined.
<prati> 2) The above #1 is not similar to Record syntax,  because even in
        record syntax it just contains the regular types, and just accessor
        are created for us !!  [11:42]
<prati> Can anyone clarify above two !!  [11:43]
<prati> @let data Person = Person { firstName :: String  , lastName :: String
        , age :: Int  } deriving (Show)   [11:44]

<prati> :t Person
<lambdabot> String -> String -> Int -> Person
<prati> @let data Person2 = Person2 String String Int

<prati> :t Person2 
<lambdabot> String -> String -> Int -> Person2
<prati> :t SimpleFuncType  [11:45]
<lambdabot> (String -> String) -> SimpleFuncType
<prati> The way I see it is, Type ( String, Int, Integer, some custom type)
        and also functions are accepted in the same way, Am I correct ?
                                                                        [11:46]

<bitemyapp> we rely on this data to make the book better. it was feedback from

            example.
<pilne> i will keep that in mind, i don't tend to do other exercises at this
        point, but i do poke my nose around a lot, and a lot of things people

<ReinH> A vty/brick based console interface wouldn't be terrible.
<bitemyapp> ReinH: I had a hard time figuring out how to fit vty/vty-ui stuff
            together  [16:53]
<bitemyapp> maybe Brick is better./

<ReinH> None of the tutorials progress beyond moving an @ around and bumping
        into walls, though, so you're pretty much on your own.
<bitemyapp> that said, vty/brick is almost certainly the way to go for a term
            ui and I have no doubt it's nicer for curses.
<bitemyapp> nicer than curses*
<ReinH> Yeah, I've been wrapping my head around brick's weird event-based but
        not reactive model.

<ReinH> I've got the beginnings of a menu system for inventory, etc, and some
        UI for player stats going.

<ReinH> Well, ncurses is fine if you want to build your own everything around

<bitemyapp> rightr
<ReinH> That said, I'd really like good 256-color terminal support in
        anything.
<ReinH> I've considered writing a little shader-based text rendering thing for
        gl to simulate a terminal interface, but then why stick with a
        text-based interface at all  [16:58]
<ReinH> Might as well switch to tiles at that point
<ReinH> maybe just use sdl2
<ReinH> bitemyapp: It might be fun to implement the Valve signed distance
        field thing for text rendering in gl with Haskell though.  [17:00]

<bitemyapp> ReinH: I've had this game idea I haven't been able to shake off,
            it'd involve a mix of text and 3d display and I've wanted to see

<cale2> kadoban: I used empty list as the identity for plenty of foldr
        functions
<kadoban> cale2: You'd probably want to either change the type of myMaximumBy
          to be safer, like maybe  :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> Maybe a
<kadoban> cale2: That's when your result is a list. Here it's not.  [20:45]
<cale2> kadoban: well the type sig has to stay the same. it's the exercise
<cale2> I just have to fill in the function 
<kadoban> cale2: You probably should peel off the head of the list then and
          use that as your "zero" element to foldr. If it doesn't have a head,
          use: error "empty list in myMaximumBy"  [20:46]
<cale2> ahhh kadoban, good call  [20:47]

<mac10688> the compiler is telling me to use a language extension but I would
           rather not if I can help it
<mac10688> is there a way to add type constraints for newtypes?
<kadoban> mac10688: With an extension there is. It was determined that that is
          a mistake to allow, basically nobody thinks it's a good idea.
                                                                        [20:49]
<kadoban> mac10688: Just put the constraint on the functions that need it
          instead.
<mac10688> ah ok
<mac10688> I was working with an exercise from the haskell book that gave me a
           function definition  [20:50]

<mac10688> implement using foldr or foldMap
<mac10688> but I don't think it's possible because I don't have a variable to
           initialize foldr
<mac10688> and there isn't a Min type to put for foldMap  [20:51]
<kadoban> mac10688: haha … read up a few lines from when you asked your
          question. cale2 had basically exactly the same problem
<Cale> Well, there are two ways to put constraints on the type. The way which
       was valid Haskell 98 was pointless. There's a way which needs the GADTs
       extension (or perhaps ExistentialQuantification) which is less
       pointless, but still pretty rarely what you're after.
<mac10688> and I dreamed of this solution when I woke up

<mac10688> cale2, kadoban yeah I agree, the return should be a maybe, I'm a
           little squimish about this function
<mac10688> so cale2 do you consider it unimplementable?
<mac10688> are you working from the book exercises too?
<mac10688> there should be a haskellbook study group somewhere
<mac10688> where is that?
<kadoban> mac10688: Being squeemish about it is good, but it is implementable,
          it just can't be "total", it has to error out on some inputs, one in
          particular
<kadoban> > maximum []
<lambdabot>  *Exception: Prelude.maximum: empty list
<mac10688> right that's what I was thinking  [20:54]
<mac10688> but as it is
<cale2> mac10688 it works just fine with the head of the list as the identity.
        It may not be safe, but it's just an exercise and I'm a beginner so I
        don't know any better haha
<cale2> But yeah, I'm just finishing up folding lists now
<mac10688> there isn't a head function for those two types cale2  [20:55]
<cale2> I don't even really know what happens when an `exception` occurs in
        ghci
<cale2> mac10688... wtf then it must not be implementable with the pure
        polymorphic types

<mac10688> what is pure polymorphic types?
<cale2> bitemyapp, you scoundrel   [20:56]
<mac10688> I wrote a ticket already but no response yet
<cale2> mac10688, I mean `a` is purely polymorphic
<mac10688> and I thought if I could make a newtype (Ord a) => Min = Min a
<mac10688> and make it a monoid type
<mac10688> and then do foldMap Min xs

<luxbock> kadoban: Haskell Programming > Folding lists > Definitions > point 2
<kadoban> Ah. I don't have the book.  [12:48]
<luxbock> "A Catamorphism is a generalization of folds to arbitrary datatypes.
          Where a fold allows you to break down a list into an arbitrary
          datatype, a catamorphism is a means of breaking down the structure
          of any datatype. The bool :: a -> a -> Bool -> a function in
          Data.Bool is an example of a simple catamorphism for a simple,
          non-collection datatype.
<luxbock> I hope that didn't cut off  [12:49]
<luxbock> Similarly, maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b is the
          catamorphism for Maybe

<prati> let churchIF c t e = c t e
<prati> @let churchIF c t e = c t e
<monochrom> that's a bad idea. Prelude already has an "and" and an "or" for a
            different purpose
<lambdabot>  Defined.
<prati> monochrom It is only for demonstration of Church Boolean !!  [13:26]
<monochrom> in other words you're now looking at a name clash
<prati> okay, I will rename them

          going to have a hard time demonstrating. Also you seem to have
          accidentally uses True instead of true in that one.
<kadoban> used*
<prati> kadoban Yes  [13:27]
<monochrom> lambdabot demonstrates the tragedy of the common
<prati> But the basic idea is above, 
<prati> My question, if I want to use churchIF  ( @let churchIF c t e = c t e
        ) to evaluate to true ,   [13:29]
<prati> In Haskell, Can function return to let declarations ( I might be using
        wrong terminology )   [13:30]
<prati> ** If I want to use churchIf ( @let churchIF c t e = c t e ) , c needs
        to be evaluated to true
<prati>  churchIF parameter "c"  ( it can be expression or function) can only
        be a type, so I won't be able to make use let, right ?  [13:32]
*** albertus1 (~albertus1@x55b5d153.dyn.telefonica.de) has joined channel

<monochrom> I don't understand the question. why must c evaluate to true? why
            can't c evaluate to false?  [13:34]
<mizu_no_oto> additionally, c is a function argument, not a type  [13:35]
<prati> yes, it can evaluate to either of "true" or "false" 
<prati> let me rephrase,  both true and false are function,   [13:36]
<prati> ** are functions
<prati> My questions is, can we have c evaluate to another function  ( true or
        false )  ?
<mizu_no_oto> prati: so c is some function of type (a -> a -> a)  [13:37]
<prati> mizu_no_oto  Thanks for pointing it to me 
<mizu_no_oto> You can't know how it was defined
<mizu_no_oto> however, there's only two possible ways that it can work: either
              it returns the first argument, or it returns the second  [13:38]
<mizu_no_oto> because it has two arguments of type a, it has no way to combine
              them together and also no way to create them ex nihilo  [13:39]
<mizu_no_oto> if you want, you could see which of those two ways it works, by
              passing in arguments and seeing what's returned  [13:40]
<prati> mizu_no_oto Okay 
<mizu_no_oto> but you can't really do that, in general
<mizu_no_oto> since most functions have a number of possible distinct
              implementations  [13:41]
<mizu_no_oto> and you can't do something like (true `or` false == true)
                                                                        [13:42]

<mizu_no_oto> regardless, "If I want to use churchIf ( @let churchIF c t e = c
              t e ) , c needs to be evaluated to true" isn't quite right:
              true 1 0 is equivalent to "if True then 1 else 0", and "false 1
              0" is equivalent to "if False then 1 else 0"  [13:44]
<mizu_no_oto> so "churchIf false 0 1" is also equivalent to "if False then 1
              else 0"  [13:45]

         wrapped-up b", the composition is really hard to understand. But if
         you read it in the one-argument, curried form (where the lift is
         apparent) it's much easier

<nitrix> Which I can't blame since everyone will have a different instinct
         about rationalizing these things.
<nitrix> I personally like to think of Functors as values in a context. It
         lets you apply a transformation to the values while preserving the
         context.  [15:38]

<Rouven> context is what I meant by "wrapped up". I know the box analogy is
         bad
<nitrix> Hence the `(a -> b)` being the transformation, and then you have this
         context f with value a, `f a`, that becomes `f b`. The value is
         transformed but the f is preserved.

<nitrix> The former with lifts seems strange to me. I guess it appeals to some
         people; but it implies that you understand currying to a decent
         level.
<nitrix> It's less instinctive if you've never been exposed to the concept. I
         find :P  [15:41]
<Rouven> definitely less instinctive, but I needed to understand it as a lift
         to understand the composition  [15:43]
<nitrix> I don't know. Keeping the former analogy, you start with a
         transformation applied to values in a context, now because it's
         composed twice and the context is preserved, you have a
         transformation applied to values in a context, in another context.
                                                                        [15:45]

<gavinhughes> This is the last prob in ch 6.14 in the book. I'm not supposed
              to change the type, only the implementation. And as, MarcelineVQ
              states, the hint is "use some arithmetic operation to combine
              values of type 'b'. Pick one."  [18:04]
<MarcelineVQ> That's right, but it's also Num b not Eq b. chk above it is Eq b
                                                                        [18:06]

<MarcelineVQ> When it comes to this book it's possible he has a different
              version where an error was corrected but in 8.0 and 9.0 that I
              have it's Num b so I'm reasonably confident it shouldn't have
              changed

        something about how pipes work

        opened elsewhere  [04:22]

<xd1le> it makes sense to make a blocking open when reading, because you want
        to wait for writers of course
<xd1le> otherwise you won't get anything
<kadoban> xd1le: I tried other writers, not haskell, and they seem to block on
          the pipe until there's any readers too.  [04:28]
<vermillon> Hello! Anyone familiar with HDBC ?
<xd1le> kadoban: thanks, i guess my thinking is wrong, maybe bash shell is
        just making it easier here  [04:30]

<xd1le> or do they fail?
<xd1le> because in haskell it's a runtime error

<xd1le> my bad
<kadoban> xd1le: I was speaking of openFileBlocking, which seems to only exist
          in GHC.IO.Handle.FD, which is not a namespace I really spend a lot
          of time in, because … why would that be GHC specific? It's just kind
          of weird.
<xd1le> fdWrite is from System.Posix.IO
<kadoban> Right

        the answer  [04:35]

<henk> ok, so the second part of your resulting tuple is clear, it’s just 'snd
       z'. For the first part you need a 'b'. But you only get an (a,c). But
       you also have a function (a -> b) meaning you can make the 'a' in (a,c)
       to a 'b' using that function.  [08:06]

*** Rizy (~Rizy@36.70.72.107) has joined channel #haskell-beginners
<roelof> henk. thanks for the tip. Im my thinking the function (a -> b)  is a

<roelof> Types are still difficult to follow sometimes 
<henk> roelof: oh, I noticed that before: I think you are misinterpreting type
       signatures … You can’t just leave out one part. It’s a bit tricky and
       I’m not sure I can explain it right, but generally the part after the
       last '->' is what the function will return.  [08:11]

<henk> So if you give that function a function and a tuple, it will return
       another tuple. If you give it _just the function_, you partially apply
       that function (i.e. you apply the (a -> b) part _but not more_) which
       will get you a new function with this signature: '(a,c) -> (b,c)'

<Solarlux> Hello all
<Solarlux> I want to learn Haskell 
<Solarlux> I have no idea how to setup IDE for Haskell
<henk> hi Solarlux, cool, so do I (: which IDE are you planning to use?
                                                                        [08:30]
<Solarlux> Codeblocks
<realitygrill> I've never heard of that IDE  [08:31]
<Solarlux> What IDE are you using?  [08:32]
<Solarlux> I don't know how 100% functional programming style works
<realitygrill> Solarlux: I was just commenting, nothing meant. I use vim, but
               that just happens to be a default  [08:33]
<henk> me neither, I barely ever used an IDE, but that doesn’t mean much,
       because I’m not a professional programmer (yet) … I use vim as well.
<Solarlux> Is it hard to program in Haskell?  [08:34]

<xd1le> Solarlux: but so far i haven't begun any large/complicated projects so
        who knows
<realitygrill> Solarlux: why do you want to learn Haskell?  [08:36]
<realitygrill> have you seen the guide yet? :)  [08:39]
<realitygrill> I think there's significant difficulty to learning it (I'm
               still doing so) but it's rewarding

<realitygrill> I'm guessing the job market is pretty shit, but hopefully that
               will be improving..  [08:42]
<Solarlux> Because i leraned Object oriented 
<Solarlux> And procedural

<demize> Well, first of all, what you're trying to show and what you're trying
         to read to is the same type, no?
<mniip> you can't exactly stick in a :: when you're applying to a composition
                                                                        [12:35]
<mniip> er, rather, applying a composition
<roelof> I think that is not always the case.  "a" and "b"  does not have to
         be the same type

<roelof> if "a" and "b" were the same you could do -> a -> a 
<demize> mniip: You can, you just need to wrap the whole thing in parens
<roelof> Dinner ready, BRB 
<mniip> demize, not really no
<mniip> you have to restrict the type of one of the composed functions  [12:37]
<mniip> as opposed to something simple like
<demize> mniip: Which you do with the ::?
<mniip> print (rountTrip 4 :: Integer)
<demize> > (read :: String -> Int) . show $ 4
<lambdabot>  4
<mniip> right

<roelof>   demize  yes, its  a roundtrip between string and back as exercise
         for pointless style   [12:58]
<demize> roelof: Then when could the two types ever be different?

         type and that why i thought a -> b schould be two different types
<demize> a->a is the same type, and is what you want.
<demize> And is even how it's written in the book...  [13:01]

            not cover and NICTA terminates in some good project-exercises.

<bitemyapp> yeah got it
<Hiro`> MarcelineVQ: my fault. it's included now
<MarcelineVQ> I blame Lokathor
<bitemyapp> Hiro`: okay so here's the deal  [17:16]
<Hiro`> This is a no blame culture (if it's definitely my fault)
<bitemyapp> Hiro`: monads for randomness are really just State for chucking
            around the seed value without noise.
<bitemyapp> usually, anyway.
<bitemyapp> the name Gen is potentially cnfusing too  [17:17]
<Hiro`> And there's something extra that generates the PRN?
<bitemyapp> not really, you have to remember that Monad is constrained to
            being clever with what you're doing structurally, it still has to
            just apply the function you provide.
<bitemyapp> it's still pure, you're still just using State to thread the seed
            around
<bitemyapp> but you need to use random-specific functions to something out of
            it.  [17:18]
<Hiro`> Right
<Hiro`> There's no obvious way to take (,) and get random numbers out of it
                                                                        [17:19]
<Hiro`> (which is what my return is)
<bitemyapp> right because you need a Gen function that does something
            intelligent
<bitemyapp> something which, given a seed, gives you a value of whatever type
            based on the seed.
<bitemyapp> you could do some silly modulo arithmetic with an Integer and turn
            that into a Char, for example.
<Hiro`> Instead I have something that takes a number and then, given a seed,
        gives it back to me  [17:20]
<bitemyapp> right because it's still just state.
<Hiro`> Yeah, but that would be a bit of side-quest
<bitemyapp> you fed it an input state, it fed it back out.
<bitemyapp> your generator isn't walking the seed forward either.
<bitemyapp> t here is really no way to know how to do any of this without
            grokking PRNG implementation with State already.
<bitemyapp> you're going to need to use other resources to figure it out.
                                                                        [17:21]
<Hiro`> when you say, "your generator isn't walking the seed forward", what
        are you referring to?
<Hiro`> could you give me the line number?
<bitemyapp> no
<bitemyapp> you have a concrete seed type
*** luigiinred (~timmygarr@150.135.210.160) has quit: Quit: luigiinred
<bitemyapp> the point of that is so you know how to generate the "next" seed.

<bitemyapp> such that asking for a value "twice" (seemingly) inside the Gen
            Monad will give you a different value.
<bitemyapp> imagine a really dumb seed lifecycle
<bitemyapp> (+1)
<bitemyapp> imagine a random generator for Bool
<bitemyapp> even, True; odd, False.
<bitemyapp> 0, after some crazy modulo arithmetic, gives you a value of

<bitemyapp> Hiro`: contrary to what you might've imagined, most mature RNGs
            don't suck up entropy for each and every number you use. They seed
            a PRNG with some initial entropy so that outsiders can't guess the
            sequence, and then walk that seed forward using an algorithm
            designed to make it unpredictable and not repeat too soon.
*** derdon (~derdon@p5B31CEC6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has quit: Ping timeout: 248

<bitemyapp> it turns out, once you have entropy in hand, you don't actually
            need IO to do this.
<bitemyapp> it's just a function and a tuple - State.
<Lokathor> the "nextNumber" function actually matches the exact shape of a
           State function  [17:26]
<Lokathor> GeneratorState -> (OutputNumber,GeneratorState)
<Hiro`> I have a crude understanding of PRNG. I'm not surprised by that
        description.
<Lokathor> a good PRNG lets you call "nextNumber" more times before you end up
           looping. It also lets you give outputs that people can look at for
           longer without being able to predict the next number (which is
           sometimes possible even before the generator loops)  [17:27]
<bitemyapp> right, what Lokathor said. the idea is to get it setup so it
            automatically "puts" the new generator state.
<bitemyapp> but the Monad is in the background. You don't really use that, you
            use, "gimmeANumba" and it talks to the Monad.  [17:28]
<bitemyapp> the Monad is dumb plumbing.

           running a local State computation (updates it's currenly held state
           value as it computes)?
<Lokathor> or are they sorta the same from outside the computation?  [17:36]
<bitemyapp> uhhhhh
<bitemyapp> ST is fuckin' magic
<bitemyapp> you can run on that understanding if you want
<bitemyapp> but we're actually writing up an explanation of ST right now and
            frankly the state thing is ephemeral, unlike lazy and strict
            state.
<bitemyapp> it's also unlifted and strict so that the representation is
            eraseable.  [17:37]

<jle`> so there isn't really a meaningful link
<bitemyapp> that's my point
<bitemyapp> it's not state in the sense that you can "touch it" or interact

<kadoban> Unless I'm missing something, I don't think that's actually relevent

          mean: after you've done runState or runST or whatever the latter is
          called, can anyone tell which you used, once you have the value? And

<emmanuel_erc> kadoban: when you used the ST monad, what were you using it

<jle`> there was a stack overflow discussion about this and the conclusion was
       that runST is just magic

*** gavinhughes (~gavinhugh@112.198.103.43) has quit: Remote host closed the
    connection
<jle`> oh, ST?
<emmanuel_erc> ST Monad
<emmanuel_erc> yeah, sorry
<jle`> ST is supposed to treat `runST x` as a normal referentially transparent
       thing
<Lokathor> emmanuel_erc, i think the old value IS destroyed, that's what makes
           it so different and magical compared to other Haskell
<jle`> so (x, runST x) should make sense
*** gavinhughes (~gavinhugh@112.198.103.43) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<jle`> or
<jle`> let st = f x in (x, runST st)
<jle`> it won't destroy the x or anything  [17:49]
<jle`> `runST st` is meant to be a pure, referentially transparent function
       that behaves like any other normal function
<jle`> er, `runST`, that is
<jle`> and st is just a normal haskell value
<emmanuel_erc> So essentially when we mean that all computational threads will
               see the same value after runST, there is really something
               magical going on to make to sure the "right" threads see that
               value.
<bitemyapp> it's less complicated than that
<jle`> i'm not sure what you mean
<bitemyapp> there's really only two things going on  [17:50]
<jle`> `runST st` just returns a value
<bitemyapp> ST enforces that you don't return a mutable reference. Whatever
            comes out of runST has to be a persistent data structure.
<jle`> and different functions can use that value
<jle`> like a normal value, etc.
<bitemyapp> the other thing is that ST has some magic baked into the structure
            of the type that enforces ordering and the like.
<Hiro`> bitemyapp: and it's just that I'm failing to use properly "random"
        arguments
<jle`> so if i runST an `ST a Int`, that just returns an Int
<jle`> nothing magical about that Int, it's just a normal Int
<jle`> runST is a normal function just like (+2) in its semantics  [17:51]
<emmanuel_erc> ok.... I think I have misunderstood sometihng.
<jle`> say an `ST s Int` describies a mutation-based algorithm that produces
       an Int
<jle`> so, `runST x` , x :: ST s Int, runs that mutation-based algorithm, and
       returns the Int
<jle`> so runST x is just the Int that is the result of that algorithm
<jle`> you can use it like a normal value anywhere you'd normally use an Int,
       it's not a magical Int :)  [17:52]
<emmanuel_erc> Right... so the magical aspect of runST refers to something
               else clearly
<jle`> runST x :: ST s Int -> Int          (ignoring the quantifier)
<jle`> yes, it referes to the implementation of an `ST s a -> a`
<Lokathor> jle`, i take it "runST x" will also be lazy as normal for haskell
           values? If you don't force it, the ST will never do any of its
           computation at all, and such?
<jle`> or, well, the implementation of `ST` such that >>= and return, etc.
       make sense  [17:53]
*** gavinhughes (~gavinhugh@112.198.103.43) has quit: Ping timeout: 256
    seconds
<bitemyapp> stuff like ST and IO are hard to understand because they don't do
            much.
<jle`> Lokathor: yeah, `let x = runST undefined in 10` will just be 10
<emmanuel_erc> So does laziness factor into the ST just like it does in normal
               lazy IO?
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: yes but you can't tug on the strict mutable computation
            like you can guarded recursion (such as a map of a list)
<Lokathor> Hiro`, what was your questions about PRNGs?
<jle`> > let x = runST undefined in "hello"
<lambdabot>  "hello"
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: so once you ask for the result of an ST computation,
            it's going to do all the work at once and give you the final
            immutable value
<emmanuel_erc> ok yea  [17:54]
<jle`> emmanuel_erc: you can think of an `ST s Int` as some description of a
       computation that returns an Int
<Lokathor> well that's fair, i guess you can't sum a list without summing the
           whole list, so it's not too different from normal things
<jle`> so `runST x` just produces the Int that's the result of that
       computation
<emmanuel_erc> right.... but ST computations are effectively strict???
<Lokathor> emmanuel_erc, i think they're saying that if any of the computation
           is forced, the whole thing is forced all at once.  [17:55]
<jle`> i believe they are, within the semantics of the ST computation
<jle`> so within an "st do block"
<jle`> but that's not special to ST
<bitemyapp> emmanuel_erc: they have to be or GHC wouldn't enforce ordering and
            the like.
<emmanuel_erc> Ok...cool.
<jle`> a lot of 'normal haskell types' can also represent "strict
       computations"
<bitemyapp> lazy state computations don't have to be evaluated in a single
            given order, part of what makes ST useful and predictable is the
            strictness.
<jle`> you can write a Monad that represents strict computations in normal
       Haskell
<jle`> so ST isn't quite special in that sense  [17:56]
<emmanuel_erc> ST is just useful when you really need to use mutation, as I
               have had to find out while working with large matrices.
<bitemyapp> What makes ST special is the mutable operations are bolted onto it
            and it has this ephemeral strict-state-like structure baked in
            that enforces ordering and the like.
<Hiro`> Lokathor: it's cool, I think I've got it. I wasn't passing anything
        interesting in to the monad. Just `return <some number>`, because I
        kind of assume that we should also construct them for ourselves.
                                                                        [17:57]

<Hiro`> I would like to know. I actually asked about stuff like this the other

<BlackCap> Either one is fine, but maybe not both at the same time  [18:10]
<Lokathor> Hiro`, well the whole point of $ is that you don't need the ( ) as
           well
<Lokathor> kinda no point to using both at the same time
<Hiro`> My logic is like this: over-use of parens is unpleasant to read
<Hiro`> ditto for ($)
<BlackCap> Personally I tend to use $ whenever I can  [18:11]
<Hiro`> hence I mix 'em up a bit
<Hiro`> is this considered bad style?
<Hijiri> It's impossible to use ($) whenever you can, if your program has at
         least one function

<Hiro`> also, sometimes ghci seems to find it hard to parse a lot of ($)'s for

<Hijiri> > ($) (($) (+1)) 1

<BlackCap> Hiro`: `sequence $ (replicate 5 $ Gen rand)` can be written as
           `sequence $ replicate 5 $ Gen rand` and `sequence (replicate 5 $

<Lokathor> Lokathor, yeah using ( ) or $ is fine, but in the specific example

<pilne> it's not 100% exactly like haskell (cuz jvm), but it is a solid effort

         frameworks. Are the frameworks in Haskell that help building Rest API

<bitemyapp> I _think_ the main issue is learning how to add to the path using
            the environment settings menu in Windows.  [20:23]
<Kaorti> yeah, Git Bash is left over from an intoductory html/javascript
         course I took

<Kaorti> I'm happy to start over from first principles, since I'm almost
         completely inexperienced already.
<Lokathor> Kaorti, the easiest way to get set up is to install stack
           (https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases) using the
           windows installer (probably 64-bit)  [20:24]
<Lokathor> it will add stack into your system PATH during the install
<bitemyapp> well that's nice of them.
<Lokathor> note that the installer is only a few MB, after that you must use
           "stack setup" to have stack obtain a copy of GHC for you  [20:25]
<Kaorti> do that from command prompt?
<Lokathor> this page here has the process in a little more detail:
           https://lokathor.gitbooks.io/haskell-stuff/content/
<Lokathor> yes, you'd run "stack setup" from a command prompt. Note that you
           must be sure to open the prompt *after* having run the installer,
           or that particular prompt won't use the updated PATH  [20:26]

<Lokathor> bitemyapp, if you like you can direct people to the front page of
           my haskell gitbook (link just above)
<Lokathor> the front page is all about installing and setup stuff (even plugs
           your book :P)  [20:30]
<Kaorti> Lokathor: thanks for the advice and link. I've got stack running, but
         I was a bit confused by the stuff about manipulating my PATH in
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw  [20:31]
<Kaorti> should I just not worry about it?

           you see)

<pilne> i'd like to make something where i implement a "good" ai, even if it
        is one that plays texas holdem in a console against the human.
<Lokathor> bitemyapp, i keep suggesting chapters you don't want to do :3c
<bitemyapp> you keep suggesting edgelord chapters
<bitemyapp> not something I can put earlier in the book
<Lokathor> i don't even know what "edgelord" means  [20:48]
<bitemyapp> and they wouldn't lend themselves well to projects from what I
            recall
<simony> hangman reminds me of programming exercises from programming 101 I
         guess (like rock paper scissors games), and don't feel "real"
<Lokathor> pilne, try a simpler game than poker to start. Try mancala for
           example
<xeorex> haha, this is nice: http://exercism.io/languages/haskell  [20:49]
<bitemyapp> pilne: Mancala board game and AI would be somewhat, but not
            drastically more, complicated than the Hangman game in the modules
            chapter.
<bitemyapp> pilne: the problem is, you could probably figure out how to do
            this yourself
<bitemyapp> pilne: but us putting it in the book will bloat the length of the
            book
<simony> Lokathor: !!! we used mancala in one of our early cs classes in
         college :D

         per se, just that i'd veer off to try doing some stuff on my own

<bitemyapp> artemis: awesome :)
<artemis> it provided just enough scaffolding to point you in the right
          direction while still leaving room for experimentation
<sm> "real" things: persistent todo list.. expense tracker.. alarm clock..
     *singing* alarm clock.. that game where you steer a guy down a
     scrolling-up road..
<pilne> i suck at UI stuff... i can mock up a functional one usually, but make
        it pretty is not my forte
<BlackCap> Backgammon please. Make a separate book on SVM and NNs  [20:53]

<pilne> although i wonder if using a browser as a frontend and haskell doing
        display to the browser....
<MarcelineVQ> pilne: steal other people's hard work, just render your ui from
              html and css
<Lokathor> pilne, your assignment is to make a program that acts like whatever
           sort of shell your computer has, BUT, common commands (ls, cd, and
           so on) should be performed internally rather than calling out to
           the normal program  [20:54]
<artemis> sm, If you are looking for things like that, there are a lot of
          projects out there you can contribute to. Most of those aren't small
          enough for exercises.
<Lokathor> should take a day or maybe a few of fiddling around with the
           pathing libraries for haskell, and you make something "real" at the
           end
<bitemyapp> can't do anything that involves UI either. It's a verbose PITA.
<sm> artemis: I'm not, just brainstorming
<simony> artemis: which chapter is the hitcounter in? :O
<bitemyapp> but the brainstorming is helpful
* sm already works on an expense tracker
<bitemyapp> sm: expense tracker / todo list - would a terminal app writing out
            to sqlite qualify?  [20:55]
<artemis> simony, 26 it also includes a nice game exercise that actually has
          you build a simplistic AI
<sm> remember david ahl's basic books ? some great simple games in there :)
<sm> bitemyapp: totally, the simplest possible sketch of one
<sm> sqlite is overkill actually, what about Show/Read
<pilne> i feel like since everything on a computer is math at the bottom of
        it, and hakell has a fundamentally simple way of expressing anything
        mathematically... haskell really can do *anything*
<simony> Ohh, I should do those exercises 😅  [20:56]
<bitemyapp> sm: I hate showing new programmers unsound things
<sm> cereal then
<bitemyapp> see nobody does the damn exercises :P
<sm> something pure haskell
<simony> I got so excited about learning transformers that i just ran off and
         implemented what I needed haha
<bitemyapp> LOL

<simony> And I think it all works 👀
<bitemyapp> artemis: shared your feedback with Julie :)
<BlackCap> Lokathor: you beat me to it
<simony> so maybe the material was so good that I didn't need to do the
         exercises 😆
<simony> (I should do the exercises)  [20:58]
<bitemyapp> we can run with that.

<bitemyapp> artemis: is there something specific here? We covered
            `transformers`, MonadTrans, and MonadIO in transformers.
<Lokathor> (2) then decide to apply a transformer to fix it up

            demonstrate.
<bitemyapp> sm: that's mtl and a totally new approach the author just came up
            with last week and wrote up today.
<simony> bitemyapp: Ohh, the `embedded` at the end of 26.8 I think  [21:05]
<bitemyapp> artemis: what do you feel is missing? Do you want to see more
            examples of it in use?
<sm> there's a section near the start on "Monad Transformers", looks like a
     decent intro
<sm> but for all I know you have a chapter all about this  [21:06]
<bitemyapp> sm: yeah
<bitemyapp> sm: the transformer chapter covers ReaderT, StateT, MonadTrans,
            MonadIO, and other things in a fair bit of depth
<sm> ha
<bitemyapp> sm: it's complemented by the previous chapter Composing Types
            which demonstrates why all this is even needed to begin with.
<artemis> bitemyapp, I think the examples are a good way to get it I guess I
          was wondering if there was a small library or package that relies
          heavily on transformers that would be good to read.
<bitemyapp> relies on is hard to say.

<artemis> oh I remember that one. Environment variables and some temporary

            you're still figuring things out.
<Lokathor> another way to put it might be, "Monad Transformers are haskell's
           version of a Software Pattern"  [21:20]
<Kaorti> Lokathor:  follow up question if you don't mind, how do I get cabal?
         Google isn't helping much.
<bitemyapp> I try not to let mess get bigger than a single Emacs buffer can
            show me without scrolling. That's my rule of thumb.
<artemis> that's a very good point about Scotty. I'll have to keep it in mind.
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: 'ish. I give 'em more credit than that.
<bitemyapp> artemis: it's worth looking back at old versions of things
<bitemyapp> artemis: see how they improved/changed the design over time.
<Lokathor> Kaorti, hmm, this is actually a tricky question. If you want cabal
           to manage a build on a project, stack does that for you
<bitemyapp> artemis: sometimes it's worth doing the obvious/naive thing at
            first.
<sm> doesn't stack setup get you cabal-install ?  [21:21]
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: there are two things called Cabal.
<Lokathor> if you want to use it as a build solver, you can use "stack install
           cabal" and it will build and install cabal for you
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: one is a library and package management system named
            Cabal. One is an executable named cabal-install used to interact
            with Cabal projects.'
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: we have a Haskell Stack video tutorial
<bitemyapp> (my coauthor and I)
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw
<Lokathor> however, the copy of cabal that stack makes for you won't intermix
           with stack at all properly because of stack and cabal having
           different assumptions about things
<artemis> bitemyapp, you don't have to tell me that one twice :) My day job is
          a front end dev and I still prototype things in jQuery before going
          to the framework of the week we decide to use.
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: the deal is, you still use Cabal if you're using Stack.
            You do not need to use cabal-install if you're using Stack.
                                                                        [21:22]
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: that is, you still specify your project dependencies,
            tests, benchmarks, executables, etc. using Cabal.
<bitemyapp> Kaorti: but you'll run your builds, fire up ghci, run your tests,
            and run your benchmarks using Stack _instead of_ cabal-install.
<bitemyapp> artemis: oh good. That's good.  [21:23]
<Lokathor> Kaorti, one thing to know is that Cabal (capital 'c') is a library
           built in with your version of GHC. and cabal (little 'c') is a
           program, sometimes called cabal-install, that helps manage builds
<bitemyapp> artemis: we kept DQ'ing people at my job recently because they
            kept wanting to use big frameworks for a tiny test project.
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: mate
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: I covered that
<Lokathor> you didn't quite explain that the capitalization matters between
           the library and the binary  [21:24]
<Lokathor> which is specifically what confused me for AGES when i started
           using stack
<bitemyapp> well, if you say so, but it's a convention.
<Kaorti> bitemyapp: I want to set up to properly do the work in your book.
         Should I just keep watching that tutorial until it gets to
         cabal/Cabal?
<bitemyapp> a way of talking about one versus the other
<bitemyapp> and I consistently used Cabal and cabal-install
<bitemyapp> and explicitly laid out the distinction
<bitemyapp> I didn't explicitly say, "the names" matter because I thought that
            was clear in the sentence I wrote to say that there are two
            different cabals.
<artemis> bitemyapp, we actually just went through the same on my team. One
          dev actually put together a prototype that was using both angular
          and dojo for different component libraries...
<bitemyapp> artemis: yoish.
<Lokathor> Kaorti, you don't need cabal to do the book work. Stack will
           suffice. the commands are slightly different, but it provides all
           the same features  [21:25]
<Kaorti> Great, thanks again. 
<bitemyapp> soooorrrrta?
<bitemyapp> the book uses cabal-install in a later chapter but if ghci and
            stack ghci work, they can get started now.
<bitemyapp> and stack can install cabal-install for them.

<bitemyapp> they went to the guide instructions, face-planted into stuff about

<bitemyapp> and getting Haskell installed more generally.

<jle`> or, Identity
<nitrix> No idea about Traverse.
<pjdelport> It's a great explanation, SPJ style, of where the functor comes
            from
<jle`> traverse f (Just x) = Just <$> f x
<jle`> where the f is `a -> f b`
<jle`> let the function effectfully manipulate the 'x' inside
<jle`> and then re-wrap it in the context
<jle`> same thing happening here -- let the 'f' effectfully manipulate the
       camera inside
<jle`> and re-wrap it in the context (the 's')  [23:28]
<nitrix> Let me digest, it's a little late.
<jle`> maybe more close would be traverse for tuples:
<jle`> traverse f (x, y) = (x,) <$> f y
<jle`> apply the effectful function 'f' to the y, and tehn re-wrap it in the
       context (being in an (x,_) tuple)  [23:29]

<jle`> it's different

<jle`> it's sort of like a functor, except it can apply an "effectful"
       function
<jle`> note:
<jle`> fmap :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b  [23:30]
<jle`> traverse :: (a -> f b) -> Maybe a -> f (Maybe b)
<nitrix> So, f is applied to x, which results into a value that's a functor.
         Then Just is applied within the functor.
<jle`> it's like mapping, but with effects
<jle`> yeah, you apply the effectful function 'f' to the 'x' inside, and then
       re-wrap it in the context
<jle`> the Just-ness
<jle`> it might be more explicit what 'context' means in traverse for tuples:
<jle`> traverse f (x, y) = (x,) <$> f y
<jle`> apply the effectful function 'f' to the y inside  [23:31]

<lambdabot>  Just [10,11,12,13]
<jle`> yeah, but an "effectful" function
<jle`> that's the point of traverse vs. fmap
<jle`> fmap :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b  [23:34]
<jle`> traverse :: (a -> f b) -> Maybe a -> f (Maybe b)
<nitrix> So the function has type (a -> f b) ?
<jle`> the function you 'map' can do effects
<jle`> yeah
<nitrix> Oh gotcha.
<jle`> so, look at the type of cameraLens:
<jle`> cameraLens :: (Camera -> f Camera) -> GameState -> f GameState
<jle`> vs., say, traverse :: (b -> f b) -> (a, b) -> f (a, b)  [23:35]
<jle`> it's like "mapping" the function over the Camera inside
<jle`> except that mapping function can do effects
<nitrix> I see.
<jle`> so, you might have mapCamera :: (Camera -> Camera) -> GameState ->
       GameState
<jle`> which can map a non-effectful function
<ski> `cameraLens f gs' allows `f' to fail (`Maybe') or to do some I/O
      computation (`IO') or to transform some state (`State s'),..
<jle`> but here you have cameraLens :: (Camera -> f Camera) -> GameState -> f
       GameState
<nitrix> :t traverse  [23:36]
<lambdabot> (Applicative f, Traversable t) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
<jle`> compare your implementation to the almost identical implementation of
       traverse for (x,y)
<nitrix> Yes.
<jle`> traverse f (x, y) = (x,) <$> f y
<nitrix> The only difference is that there's not really a `t`.
<nitrix> Is it faking that GameState is a Traversable?  [23:37]
<jle`> mhm
<jle`> it's like a generalized form of a traverse
<nitrix> :t lens
<lambdabot> Functor f => (s -> a) -> (s -> b -> t) -> (a -> f b) -> s -> f t
<jle`> well, a 'lens' in particular is a traversal with exactly one value
       traversed
<jle`> let's see what the implementation of `traverse` for (x, y) typechecks
       as:
<ski> `GameState' has kind `*'. `Traversable' applies to types of kind `* ->
      *'. "GameState is a Traversable" is a type-incorrect phrase
<jle`> :t \f (x, y) -> (x,) <$> f y
<lambdabot> Functor f => (t -> f a) -> (t1, t) -> f (t1, a)
<nitrix> ski: noted.  [23:38]
<jle`> 'traverse' for tuples is exactly a lens, except unnecessarily
       specialized to only Applicatives
<nitrix> So, Lens has its own more generic version of Traversable that works
         on :: * ?
<jle`> yeah, and a Lens needs only Functor  [23:39]
<jle`> whereas Traversable needs more power -- Applicative
<jle`> but note that there's a name for something "like" a Lens, but needs
       Applicative
<jle`>    -- it's called ....  a Traversal! :O
<jle`>  (the point of that was to show that lenses and traversals have a deep
       connection)  [23:40]
<ski> a traversable represents a generic structure/"collection" of "elements"
      that can be of any type the *user* chooses. however in the case of
      lenses, there needn't be present this sort of generality. you can have a
      lens describing a path to a `Camera' in a `GameState' without
      simultaneously allowing a similar path to any `X' whatsoever in a
      `GameStateExceptWithXInsteadOfCamera'
<jle`> but yeah, neat thing you can do with a (Camera -> f Camera) ->
       GameState -> f GameState is that you can choose an 'f' that does the
       effects you want
<jle`> for example, say you want to simply map a (Camera -> Camera) over the
       GameState  [23:41]
<jle`> then, you can pick 'Identity' as your "effect"
<jle`> and you get a simple mapper
<nitrix> I see.
<ski> another difference is that a traversable doesn't just "point to" *one*
      element, but to a *collection* of them. that's why it needs
      `Applicative', namely in order to be able to *combine* the individual
      effects done to transform each of them into a single compound effect
      done to transform the whole structure
*** suls (~suls@133.237.7.89) has joined channel #haskell-beginners  [23:42]
<jle`> nitrix: if you pick 'Const' as your "effect", you can implement "view"
<jle`> which would be a fun exercise
<nitrix> So, I think I understand 70~80%.  [23:43]
<nitrix> Which is already super good.
<jle`> congrats :)
<jle`> what the 'lens' library provides (among other things) is nice
       combinators to manipulate (Camera -> f Camera) -> GameState -> f
       GameState's and using effects to do useful things  [23:44]
<jle`> for example, over :: Lens' GameState Camera -> (Camera -> Camera) ->
       GameState -> GameState
<jle`> it uses the lens with Identity, like i described earlier, to do exactly
       what i mentioned --- turn it into a normal, non-effectful map

      `case keysymKeycode (keyboardEventKeysym ked) of'
<nitrix> good point  [00:05]
<ski> hm, and i'd consider factoring `modify $ camera %~' out of that `case'
<ski> hm, or no. there's an `_ -> return ()'  [00:06]
<nitrix> ski: There's going to be more keys in there.

<nitrix> I see where you're coming from, but I'm also planning ahead here :P
<nitrix> jle`: So, would you say you understand lens decently good?  [00:07]
<jle`> btw, the reason why lenses compose is tied to the how traversals
       compose
<nitrix> How long have you been doing Haskell, just to give me an idea :/
<jle`> (traverse . traverse) print will traverse and print everything in a
       two-layers-deep traversal  [00:08]
<nitrix> jle`: Similar to (fmap . fmap)
<jle`> (traverse . traverse) print [Just 1, Just 2, Nothing, Just 4]
<jle`> that'll print 1, 2, and 4
<jle`> yeah, exactly
<nitrix> Gotcha.
<jle`> that's why (camera . _1) etc. work
<jle`> it's just lifting traversals "one more" layer deep
<jle`> i've been doing haskell for a few years now?  [00:09]
<nitrix> It'll be a year soon for me, on and off.
<nitrix> So I guess there's still hope.

<oldmanmike> Question: If I run repa concurrently with other subsystems
             (network connections, loggers, etc.), will repa starve the RTS
             scheduler?  [00:33]
<Lokathor> oldmanmike, it's a rather smart scheduler, I don't think so  [00:34]
<Lokathor> worst case, a repa computation will complete all the way and then
           be forced to wait on more input, and which point another thread
           will be allowed to activate
<Lokathor> so it won't like, lock up your whole program  [00:35]

<oldmanmike> It's going to be used to pass over a stream of 3D vectors in what
             will be a game server loop
<Lokathor> well, it's either an infinite stream, in which case you're kinda
           doing what i just said not to (:P) or it's a finite stream that
           you're sticking values onto the end of from time to time to
           *simulate* it being like an infinite stream  [00:38]
<Lokathor> in the latter case, if it tries to read out of the stream, and the
           stream is empty, that will block, which will allow the scheduler to
           start someone else, hopefully someone with the ability to do
           something that ends up writing into the stream  [00:39]
<oldmanmike> Would io-streams/pipes/conduits be the middle ground here?
                                                                        [00:41]
<Lokathor> well, if you're going to be doing complicated concurrent work, my
           first thought is to STM
<Lokathor> it provides a TChan type, which lets someone write to one end and
           another can read from the other end, which is basically what you're
           after if I'm understanding correctly  [00:42]
<Lokathor> the processing thread pulls some data out, does the repa thing, and
           then writes the results to some sort of screenbuffer or... however
           that gets shown
<oldmanmike> I'm still trying to figure some of that stuff out for myself :)

<oldmanmike> Yay!
<oldmanmike> GC and scheduler would be my requests
<bitemyapp> weeeelll  [00:58]
<bitemyapp> I hope you like white papers. Anyhoodle. uno momento.
<oldmanmike> btw do you touch on that stuff at all in the book?
             Appendiceeeeeeesss??????
<bitemyapp> some? sorta? It's not really our focus.  [00:59]
<bitemyapp> The book assumes you know fuck all
<bitemyapp> fuck all is close to being the empty set
<bitemyapp> so it doesn't include C or pointers
<bitemyapp> so we can only talk about the RTS in a, uh, certain way.
<bitemyapp> We're in the middle of going into some detail about ST and IO
            though.
<bitemyapp> we can't really satisfy every intermediate-or-advanced niche 
<bitemyapp> in a book that's already too long  [01:00]
<bitemyapp> something like the RTS is something we'd do a whole book about
<oldmanmike> Well, not how to contribute to RTS, but stuff like what it means
             to have a generational GC and how RTS deals with prodominantly
             purely functional algorithms
<bitemyapp> mate
<bitemyapp> do you know how much somebody needs to know to grok all that?
<bitemyapp> seriously walk the graph nodes backwards and count up all the
            things you have to understand to get at the details of those
            topics  [01:01]
<bitemyapp> you aren't done until you've recursed beyond malloc to things
            like, "bits don't mean anything"
<Lokathor> oldmanmike, i haven't hacked on GHC, you want MarcelineVQ for that
<bitemyapp> #ghc too, but I'm gathering links.  [01:02]
<bitemyapp> #ghc will not gather links for you
<MarcelineVQ> :X
<bitemyapp> #ghc will be helpful if you ask a specific question, otherwise
            tell you to google or use the Trac.
<Lokathor> "bits don't mean anything"?  [01:03]
<oldmanmike> Lokathor: I asked because there's a part of me that wants to look
             into improving the GHC error system, and I'm trying to judge the
             skill level I'll need in order to tackle that
<Lokathor> i'm already lost
<bitemyapp> Lokathor: I have news for you
<Lokathor> oh no :(
<Lokathor> my bits
<Lokathor> i kept them so carefully
<Lokathor> rampant bitflation has devalued my collection, now people expect 64
           at once these days!  [01:04]
<Lokathor> oldmanmike, well, as I understand it, MarcelineVQ is somewhere
           between me and bitemyapp on the skill scale, and has made several
           contributions to GHC I think
<MarcelineVQ> Lokathor went bankrupt because they told him endianess didn't
              matter anymore  [01:05]
<oldmanmike> I prefer funsize-endian
<Lokathor> I'd know more haskell, but there's all this historical drama to
           watch :O  [01:06]
<MarcelineVQ> Just one so far, some in the works though. I'm like a tiny bug
              staring at a titanic pillar of salt, the shape of which if
              vaguely human and the sparkling boulders which tumble towards me
              cut the air in warbling screams.
<Lokathor> tonight is Marco Polo
<MarcelineVQ> Also it's a cool project.
<oldmanmike> You wouldn't call it "crufty"?  [01:07]
<MarcelineVQ> The build system could be called crufty, but that's being worked
              on

<ReinH> If you want to see what a Haskell impl would look like, there's
        https://hackage.haskell.org/package/chaselev-deque  [02:57]
<ReinH> You can see the actual implementation at
        https://github.com/jwiegley/ghc-release/blob/master/rts/WSDeque.c if
        you want to go blind  [02:58]
<ReinH> That may not be the current version actually

<ReinH> It's actually not so bad compared to the rest of the RTS, only 300
        lines, most of which are comments.
<ReinH> There's also http://blog.ezyang.com/2013/01/the-ghc-scheduler/ and
        https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Rts/Scheduler for
        commentary on the scheduler  [03:00]
<ReinH> And ezyang also wrote a nice paper sumarizing the RTS:

<julianleviston> xeorex: don’t get confused… I don’t think x = 5 is defining a
                 variable. I think it’s defining a name for a value.  [05:12]
<pjdelport> Usually, to be precise about things like mutation, people refer to
            mutable variables as "references"
<julianleviston> xeorex: but in f x = 5 + x we have a variable labeled x for
                 the function f.
<julianleviston> xeorex: this is, at least, my understanding of it.
<Rouven> It's an argument
<julianleviston> Rouven: it is.  [05:13]
<Rouven> x gets bound when you apply f and never changes
<julianleviston> Rouven: yep.
<julianleviston> Rouven: but it’s sometimes called a variable, too.
<julianleviston> Rouven: as I understand it, at least.
<julianleviston> https://wiki.haskell.org/Variable
<srhb> It is certainly a variable in the most common sense.  [05:14]
<julianleviston> Oh look at that, sometimes it seems we use it to mean x = 5
                 too… apologies xeorex 
<Rouven> in the algebra sense
<srhb> OK, that was a bit aggressive. Common in maths, yes.
<xeorex> The biggest misunderstanding of Haskell comes from the fact that we
         use the same words for completely different things between Haskell
         and other programming languages such as Java
<srhb> It is not on of those mutable wrongly-named variables from other
       programming languages. :-)
<julianleviston> srhb: yes, but then again other languages also use the word
                 function to mean “a set of instructions to be executed
                 sequentially” but that’s nothing like what Haskell calls a
                 function.  [05:15]
<srhb> julianleviston: Right.
<julianleviston> srhb: which is the source of a *lot* of confusion, it seems

<srhb> And there is a perfectly good word for subroutine, which they don't
       use.
<xd1le> julianleviston: which languages are that?
<srhb> It's a shame.
<xd1le> yeah wow, that's weird
<julianleviston> xd1le: almost all of them, I think. C, JS, swift, Java (I
                 think), clojure
<julianleviston> I actually don’t know if lambdas in Java are pure.  [05:17]
<realitygrill> I think of it as, wipe your memory and take all the names from
               math tradition
<srhb> realitygrill: That's a good rule of thumb :)
<julianleviston> haha :) yeah
<xeorex> realitygrill: agreed
<xd1le> i always thought of 'function' as in used in haskell
<srhb> The only thing where I'm sure "we" made a mistake is the Haskell return
<xd1le> i don't understand why subroutine is confused with function, that
        seems so strange  [05:18]
<julianleviston> xd1le: so did my little brother, which made learning ruby as
                 his first language totally confusing to him

<julianleviston> xd1le: as always, it depends what you want to learn a
                 language for.
<srhb> I've taught it to first year CS students with no programming
       background, and it didn't seem to be harder (or easier, really, except
       for the very mathy types) to learn
<julianleviston> xd1le: my brother isn’t a children :)
<xd1le> ah right, misplaced assumption there
<xd1le> sorry  [05:20]
<xeorex> a child?
<xeorex> hehe
<julianleviston> my brother is 27
<xd1le> xeorex: little brother may not necessarily mean a child
<xeorex> it would certainly not be children
<julianleviston> He learnt ruby when he was 20, I think.
<xd1le> i knew a bit of es2015 and a bit of C before starting to learn haskell
                                                                        [05:21]
<xd1le> sorry not es2015, es5
<xd1le> and a lot of haskell books/tutorials speak so much of other languages
<xd1le> at least that's my observation
<julianleviston> xd1le: I think all of them do.
<realitygrill> my own guess is that it makes more sense for a little bit
                                                                        [05:22]
<realitygrill> then sharply veers off the rails
<realitygrill> (for first timers who get into Haskell as a first language)
<xd1le> julianleviston: i think ruby and other OO-like languages use only
        what's known as 'methods' rather than functions right?
<julianleviston> xd1le: ruby can be functional… in a very loose definition of
                 that word
<xd1le> i don't really know what a method not bound to a object is though
                                                                        [05:23]
* realitygrill overgeneralizes from his own experience of "okay. okay. hmm.
  okay. WTFFFFFF"
<julianleviston> xd1le: they’re called functions then, but yes, if they’re
                 attached to objects, they’re methods.
<julianleviston> xd1le: mind you, they’re not pure, so they may as well be
                 called procedures.
<xd1le> yes well not many languages are pure anyway
<xd1le> unless i'm wrong  [05:24]
<xeorex> The haskellbook doesn't compare with other languages

<xd1le> i don't really know python, but i've written some small programs in it
<pjdelport> You can do a lot worse than Python as a first language.
<xd1le> pjdelport: which ones?
<pjdelport> Almost all of them? :)
<xd1le> sorry i find this topic interesting :p
<xeorex> xd1le: It remains a loose type language, so not ideal for detecting
         errors on compilation  [05:29]
<xd1le> yeah but what about lisp?
<pjdelport> My languages of choice are pretty much Haskell and Python.
<xd1le> xeorex: well there is no compilation
<pjdelport> Scheme is very good to learn too.
<pjdelport> I'd probably add it to the above list, but I rarely use Scheme in
            practice.  [05:30]
<xd1le> is scheme 'functional'?
<pjdelport> (But it's still really good to learn from, especially with a good
            text like SICP.)
<julianleviston> xd1le: no.
<julianleviston> xd1le: well… it’s not pure.
<xd1le> yeah 'functional' is hard to define
<xd1le> i mean like, first class functions at least?  [05:31]
<pjdelport> Scheme is generally considered functional, yes, but it's not pure
            or lazy like Haskell.
<julianleviston> xd1le: mind you SICP directs one to use a more pure style,
                 so...
<julianleviston> pjdelport: it *can* be used lazily pretty easily. SICP has
                 some stuff about that in it.

<xd1le> as in, yeah that's like macros in lisp
<xd1le> ah i didn't know that
<xd1le> edsl is in embedded domain specific language

            libraries, in Haskell.  [06:09]
<julianleviston> pjdelport: same with ruby isn’t it?  [06:11]
<xd1le> e.g. clay is sort of like a edsl in haskell
<julianleviston> one of the problems here with ruby is that the modules kind
                 of aren't.

<julianleviston> SomeT: so you’ve never written a function before?

<julianleviston> SomeT: you just used one earlier
<SomeT> would it be something like print (hello) -> hello

<julianleviston> someFunction x = x is how we write a function in Haskell

<julianleviston> xd1le: in Haskell, all functions are curried.
<xd1le> julianleviston: that's my point
<julianleviston> xd1le: oh, sorry. I thought you were actually asking
<xd1le> ah sorry, thought there was something like 'non-curried' in haskell
<julianleviston> xd1le: s/he was just asking about tuples, so I assumed they
                 meant they ddn’t want a tuple based function
<julianleviston> xd1le: well there is… if you use tuples it’s not curried.
                                                                        [07:07]
<xd1le> yeah i see, but the second question just says takes two strings
<julianleviston> xd1le: there’s even an uncurry function :)
<xd1le> "input" strings would be slightly more complicated though
<xd1le> oh, okay
<julianleviston> xd1le: the second question?
<julianleviston> xd1le: sometimes we talk about arguments to a function as
                 “inputs” to that function 
<xd1le> as in, maybe SomeT wants the user to *input* two strings  [07:08]

<julianleviston> xd1le: in the IO sense.
<xd1le> julianleviston: second question as in the return the greatest string
<SomeT> I guess the function would contain the string?
<julianleviston> xd1le: you can compose a monadic value that does it.
<SomeT> or the function is the string

<julianleviston> SomeT: Do you want to learn yourself, or to be told the
                 answer?  [07:10]
<SomeT> bit of both haha
<julianleviston> I don’t think I can do that :)
<julianleviston> SomeT: I’ll try.
<julianleviston> SomeT: so… all functions in Haskell are curried.
<SomeT> ok yes
<SomeT> I get that  [07:11]
<julianleviston> SomeT: ok
<julianleviston> SomeT: so if we were to create a function someString x y
                 that returned only the first string (the x), then we’d write
                 it like this: someString x y = x 
<SomeT> ah ok makes perfect sense
<SomeT> aapart from the string part  [07:12]
<julianleviston> SomeT: because of currying, this equates to this: someString
                 x = \y -> x
<SomeT> so itsa not actually printing a string because its a funnctiion
<julianleviston> SomeT: yeah, the signature specialises it to string
<xd1le> 'someString' is just the name of the function
<julianleviston> SomeT: depending on what you mean by “printing”, no.
<SomeT> I get it now
<SomeT> thanks
<julianleviston> SomeT: someString = \x -> \y -> x
<julianleviston> they’re all equivalent
*** sathish_haskell (~sathish_h@75.143.16.8) has quit: Ping timeout: 240
    seconds  [07:13]
<julianleviston> SomeT: now, if you want a function that returns the longest
                 one, you’ll need to use the length function on them… with
                 some kind of conditional
<julianleviston> SomeT: someString x y = if length x > length y then x else y
<julianleviston> SomeT: but if lengths are equal, that will return the second
                 one. I don’t know what you want to happen in that case.
                                                                        [07:14]
<SomeT> so thats aString :: Foldable t => t a -> t a -> t a
<julianleviston> SomeT: that signature generalises it to any list, which will
                 work for String because String = [Char].
<julianleviston> SomeT: actually any kind of foldable container.
<SomeT> ok thanbks  [07:16]
<SomeT> makes sense
<SomeT> what about this
<SomeT> -- c.) A curried function that inputs three numbers and returns a
        3-tuple containing each of the inputs multiplied by ten
<SomeT> let a b c = a * b * c = if a b c = * [a,b,c]
<xd1le> in haskell
<xd1le> 'if's always need else  [07:17]

<julianleviston> SomeT: why are you doing while ill then?
<xd1le> also
<xd1le> tuple is with parentheses right?
<julianleviston> xd1le: tuples require parens, yes.
<xd1le> not square brackets
<julianleviston> xd1le: and there are 3 “=“ in there!  [07:19]
<julianleviston> xd1le: and I have no idea what * [a,b,c] is supposed to be.
<xd1le> yes same
<xd1le> and "if"
<julianleviston> SomeT: write a function that takes one argument, and
                 multiplies it by ten, first.  [07:20]
<SomeT> aFunction (a) * 10
<xd1le> nearly
<julianleviston> SomeT: no.
<julianleviston> SomeT: in haskell we define our functions like this:
<julianleviston> someFunction name = “Hello, “ ++ name
<xd1le> remeber someString x y = x 
<SomeT> aFunction (a)= * 10  [07:22]
<julianleviston> SomeT: closer.  [07:23]
<julianleviston> SomeT: you don’t need brackets.
<SomeT> aFunction a= * 10
<julianleviston> SomeT: but also, that is an error because * takes two
                 arguments, and you have only one.
<xd1le> why just "* 10"

<xd1le> the concept of "get the longer string out of the two"

<xd1le> yeah i guess
<xd1le> so infix vs prefix
<xd1le> notation
<julianleviston> Haskell is a lot of very simple things built on top of each
                 other with some really nice syntax sugar on top… but you do
                 need to know all the pieces, I suppose.   [07:46]
<julianleviston> xd1le: one reason why I thought studying reading before
                 writing was a good idea - to familiarise the learner with all
                 the pieces and lots of practice reading before they started
                 to construct their own things…   [07:47]
<xd1le> i think that's a good idea too
<julianleviston> personally feel like it’s a big gap in learning material and
                 you either fill it with your own will-power (to push through
                 it all), or just keep smashing your head on it until it makes
                 sense.  [07:48]

<julianleviston> xd1le: yeah, but my point is you don’t fully understand all
                 the material that’s covered because you don’t get a chance to
                 see it in many places, do exercises on it, learn how to write
                 things with it.  [07:54]
<realitygrill> i just tried other books at the point of the more advanced
               topics
<julianleviston> even most exercises in books are very light on…. “here, there
                 are 10 things to do with this particular topic”… but that’s
                 not what’s needed.
<xd1le> julianleviston: yeah i think you are correct, i didn't let that bother
        me and just continued trying to learn with other resources
<julianleviston> what we need is 10 exercises of varying kinds that do much
                 different things.
<xd1le> but it would be nice to understand it all as you go through  [07:55]

                 if you’re not going to actually learn and understand any of
                 it...
<realitygrill> lyah?
<realitygrill> fair enough
<xd1le> well not "any" of it
<xd1le> i think i got a lot of it
<xd1le> i guess the point is to get familiar with it  [07:56]
<julianleviston> realitygrill:  yeah.
<julianleviston> xd1le: ah, but if it’s to get familiar with it, why the very
                 shallow walk? why not show many examples of everything?
<xd1le> yeah i don't disagree
<xd1le> i'm not saying lyah is perfect  [07:57]
<xd1le> i'm a haskell newbie so i wouldn't even know
<xd1le> i don't know exactly why, but haskell is quite attractive to me
                                                                        [07:58]
<julianleviston> xd1le: it’s freaking awesome! :)
<julianleviston> xd1le:  hehe :)
<julianleviston> maybe that’s why
<xd1le> i guess it's the static typing
<xd1le> as in, the strong type system
<xd1le> it's really great  [07:59]
<realitygrill> that's pretty neat, though takes a while to learn/get used to
<realitygrill> then you're like "whaa holyshit"
<julianleviston> xd1le: I kinda wish we had better support for taking the
                 static types into the dynamic world too sometimes… like…
                 taking the type system on the road with us :)
<julianleviston> xd1le: the Dynamic typeclass...  [08:00]
<xd1le> as in many languages have static typing, but i haven't really "taken
        advantage" of it like how you can with haskell
<julianleviston> doesn’t really quite cut it tho… I think.
<xd1le> before learning haskell that is
<julianleviston> xd1le: not many languages have the Hindley-Milner type
                 checker.
<realitygrill> haskell ruined me for those languages
<xd1le> julianleviston: what do you mean?
<julianleviston> xd1le: about what?  [08:01]
<xd1le> as in "the dynamic world"
<julianleviston> xd1le: oh… well, some things I program need to be dynamically
                 typed.

<xd1le> how would static typing work there though?
<julianleviston> ?  [08:02]
<xd1le> if you can't even catch things statically that is...
<xd1le> it would still be dynamic
<xd1le> so like, what's the point
<julianleviston> xd1le: well, I *can* do quite a lot of this stuff
<xd1le> as in, you said "taking static types into the dynamic world"
<xd1le> what do you mean by that?
<julianleviston> xd1le: runtime type checking would be nice sometime.  [08:03]
<xd1le> oh right
<julianleviston> xd1le: like, for example, I have an environment I’m working
                 on where code is stored in a DB and I’m using something
                 written in haskell to edit it.
<julianleviston> and I load that code in at runtime.
<julianleviston> but shhhh you’re not supposed to do this ;-)
<xd1le> yeah you shouldn't
<xd1le> you mean loading *other* language code into your haskell program?
                                                                        [08:04]
<julianleviston> Yeah, it kinda went against every fabric of my being.
<julianleviston> no
<julianleviston> haskell
<xd1le> oh the other way?
<xd1le> yeah that's asking for it :p
<julianleviston> xd1le: Haskell… loading haskell
<julianleviston> xd1le: works fine :)
<xd1le> oh
<xd1le> right, interesting

                 environment, and gives you a result if you pass it some
                 arguments.
<julianleviston> It’s all very scary :)
<xd1le> if you're editing code, couldn't you just try do some metaprogramming
        things?
<julianleviston> I’d prefer it if it was more supported, though.
<julianleviston> xd1le:  haha I’m not too sure how to understand what you just
                 said...  [08:06]
<xd1le> i.e. template haskell
<julianleviston> xd1le: No that’d be the other way
<julianleviston> xd1le: This is called gradual typing sometimes, I think
<xd1le> "I'm using something written in haskell to edit it"
<julianleviston> xd1le: the Data.Dynamic class for example  [08:07]
<xd1le> ah well i don't know any of this haha
<julianleviston> xd1le: it’s a bit complex, but what I have is a Snap web
                 application… which allows me to edit an application layer
                 from within it.
<xd1le> interesting. but seems convoluted.  [08:08]
<julianleviston> xd1le: I haven’t finished it yet, and it was doing my head
                 in, but I had the core of it more or less working

             request is served by the restful api developed in Haskell 
<Guest85518> so how does the response gets rendered in the front end html/css
             javascript style ?  [08:40]
<boj> Guest85518: that is one way to approach it.  you make an http request to
      the backend (any code base is fine, but Haskell works in this example)
      using more than likely javascript (jquery, angular.js, backbone,js,
      react, etc)
<Guest85518> and another approach ?  [08:41]
<boj> Guest85518: that is more of a frontend question specific to whatever
      technology you use
<boj> Guest85518: another approach could be websockets i suppose
<boj> Guest85518: either way you are consuming data from a http server api.

<srhb> It certainly returns True if the lists are equal...
<xd1le> srhb: isn't that correct?
<srhb> Yes.  [09:56]
<xd1le> oh no i mean the first answer
<srhb> Yes :)
<xd1le> the second one is wrong
<srhb> It PROBABLY is, but the problem statement is vague.
<srhb> (It doesn't say that it should be False is the lists are not equal)
<xd1le> well, it's not using a or b
<srhb> Technically foo _ _ = True should be fine
<xd1le> SomeT probably wants a function to compare two lists, not `foo _ _ =
        True`  [09:57]
<srhb> BUt really, the problem statement seems like there are more problems,
       considering the mentions of curried
<xd1le> yes
<srhb> xd1le: Yes, I think so too. :)
<xd1le> earlier
<xd1le> there was a question saying "make a curried function..."
<xd1le> but all functions are curried
<xd1le> so...
<SomeT> yes unless you add ()  [09:58]

        -> Int) and returns the result of applying the first function to one
        and adding this to the result of applying the second function to two.
        my answer is: let aFunction1 && aFunction2 a b = 1,2 == 1
<SomeT> this one is confusing  [09:59]
<xd1le> "&&" ?
<srhb> SomeT: You need to understand how value definition works
<srhb> SomeT: How do you define a name to have some value?
<xd1le> srhb: is the && operator being used correctly here?
<xd1le> i don't think so  [10:00]
<srhb> xd1le: Not unless they're defining (&&) and even then, there are issues
<xd1le> SomeT: "1,2 == 1" doesn't make sense
<srhb> > let a && b = False in True && False
<lambdabot>  False
<srhb> > let a && b = False in True && True

<xd1le> SomeT: what did try to mean with that part?
<SomeT> at least 
<SomeT> I had a go at it  [10:01]
<SomeT> now I can break down my mistakes
<xd1le> the question talks about applying fucntions
<xd1le> so you need to use your functions..
<xd1le> SomeT: do you know what they mean by "inputs two functions (each of
        type Int -> Int)"?  [10:02]
<SomeT> yes
<SomeT> two integers
<xd1le> no
<SomeT> so its like 5 + 10 then answer plus answerr
<xd1le> no
<xd1le> it takes two *functions*  [10:03]
<xd1le> and each of those functions takes *one* integer
<xd1le> and returns an integer
<xd1le> SomeT: so what would a function like that be?  [10:04]

<xd1le> your "a b c" part will *be* the functions
<srhb> SomeT: Stop guessing at completely wrong solutions
<srhb> SomeT: Try to answer the questions, they're meant to help you
       understand
<srhb> Instead of randomly mashing in things that may or may not be marginally

<xd1le> so something like `aFunction f g = ...`  [10:08]
<xd1le> where "f" and "g" *are* those functions
<xd1le> with type `Int -> Int`
<xd1le> (each)  [10:09]
<xd1le> also you don't need && right now
<srhb> Perhaps simplify a bit  [10:10]
<SomeT> let function1, function2 a b = 1, 2 = a + b
<srhb> SomeT: A function is defined like this in haskell: name arg1 arg2 arg3

<SomeT> ok
<srhb> Only the right hand side.
<xd1le> BTW
<xd1le> in ghci

*** justicefries (sid26447@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-hpkiakumcwnycfyl) has

<xd1le> to do that, you need to define the test1 and test2 functions
<SomeT> thats easy  [10:34]
<SomeT> so you just do 1 + 2
<srhb> An example of such a function would be add1 x = 1 + x

*** dwins (~dwins@50.153.242.210) has quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds

<xd1le> or just add1 = (+1)
<SomeT> let test test1 test2 1 6 = test1 1 + test2 2
<srhb> Not even close  [10:35]
<srhb> That's function definition again
<SomeT> :(
<xd1le> no
<srhb> Whenever you use =, you're defining something
<xd1le> when you do "let test .."
<xd1le> you are defining "test"
<SomeT> yes
<srhb> But you want to USE it
<xd1le> but you need to define "test1" and "test2"

<srhb> The one you worked out before
<SomeT> let test test1(5) test2(5)= test1 1 + test2 2
<srhb> Then press enter

<srhb> Then try to write test (+1) (+2)
<xd1le> no brackets like that!  [10:36]
<srhb> Let me paste a ghci session
<SomeT> let test (+1) (+2) test1 test2= test1 1 + test2 2
<SomeT> that does not work

<srhb> Oh there it is
<xd1le> works for me
<srhb> http://lpaste.net/5136337568081641472
<srhb> So you use "let" to define the function, but no "let" to simply
       evaluate it applied to some arguments.
<xd1le> so the line 3 there is *using* the "test" function defined in line 2
                                                                        [10:38]

<lambdabot>  8
<srhb> (+3) is a function that adds 3 to a number

<pjdelport> Roelof: I'm back, sorry. :)
<Roelof> NP
<Hijiri> BlackCap: well, what if any wasn't already written  [12:18]
<pjdelport> The idea of trace is that you can wrap it around any expression,
            and it will print its message as part of evaluating that
            expression.
<Hijiri> also monoids are useful for more general folds
<Roelof> sometimes you have other things to do 
<Hijiri> :t getAny . foldMap (Any . (== 5))
<lambdabot> (Eq a, Num a, Foldable t) => t a -> Bool
<pjdelport> So it's a convenient way of bypassing referential transparency and
            inserting printing side effects anywhere.
<Hijiri> (foldMap f is like mconcat . map f)
<Roelof> pjdelport:  oke, so I can see what really happens. That is what im
         looking for   [12:19]
<pjdelport> Roelof: So the trick is figuring out which evaluations you want to
            trace.
<Roelof> at this moment all guards, So I can see why dividedBy 10 2 never
         reach the end 
<Roelof> if that is not possible , only the last one   [12:20]
<pjdelport> Roelof: In this case, the steps of the go function is what you
            want to trace, so you want to insert a trace in each body that
            you're interested in.

<pjdelport> You could try something like:

<MarcelineVQ> emmanuel_erc: to add, smart constructors come to mind for a
              problem like that, which is when you make a function that
              creates the value you want. But you can also choose to not
              export that datatype's normal constructors, so users can only
              get that type by using your smart constructor.

<MarcelineVQ> I think it should be more specific about what it wants though,
              whether you're allowed to use div (probably not) or what the
              signature should be for the final function. Earlier dividedBy
              was actually more like divMod in that it gave you the remainder
              too and the `Result Integer` of this one suggests it just wants
              the function to be like div which discards the remainder

<Hiro`> So I've got to the final set of the Monad Challenges. They're not
        actually writen yet, but the basic gist is to rewrite everything using
        do notation. Great, but there's not actually been any explanation of
        it. Is there anywhere that explains the mapping between standard
        monadic syntax and do syntax in a particularly succinct way?  [16:22]

<monochrom> about the only common expectation is that fail "xxx" happens when

<gads> Hi everybody.  I'm having trouble understanding currying.  What is
       really going on when you curry f(x,y) = x+y?  I realize we are taking
       one argument 'per function', but how?  [19:46]
*** skeet70 (~skeet70@host-174-45-94-21.bzm-mt.client.bresnan.net) has joined

<monochrom> I don't know what is f there and why it has anything to do with +
<monochrom> but a curried function, such as "take", is used as "take 1
            [a,b,c]" as opposed to "take(1, [a,b,c])"  [19:48]
<monochrom> you can further dissect it to find: "take 1" is still a function,
            waiting for one more parameter.  [19:49]
*** douglascorrea (~douglasco@191.177.186.211) has quit: Remote host closed

       the new list...I think.    [20:08]

<Big_G> rardiol1, I can't speak to what is technically possible but you should
        be doing that design either way IMO  [22:40]

*** taoistpage (~taoistpag@24-139-36-47.fidnet.com) has quit: Quit: Be back

<Big_G> rardiol1, It makes everything clean. If you put a function in a
        library, I know that it is designed for that context. It also makes
        stuff like testing a lot easier because you can import the functions
        you need to test  [22:42]
<Big_G> Also prevents the gigantic files that can sometimes come about

<rardiol1> can't I just use separate modules/files  for that?

*** malaclyps (~malaclyps@unaffiliated/malaclyps) has joined channel

<rardiol1> well, a module I think is one per file, as defined by the module {}
           where at the beggining of every file  [22:45]
<rardiol1> a library is.. I don't know. something else more complicated, like
           with a separate build and on a separate folder structure?
<rardiol1> I already separate it into multiple files in folders  [22:46]
<rardiol1> But I can't find out how to make the haddock comments, and a
           cursory search indicates stack haddock doesn't work with
           executables  [22:47]
<rardiol1> so I wanted to maybe separate the libraries from the dumb small
           main executable

<MarcelineVQ> http://lpaste.net/151785 based on this I'd say no, I'm pretty
              amateur at reading it though
<jle`> @src foldl  [02:36]
<lambdabot> foldl f z []     = z
<lambdabot> foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
<qualiaqq> jle`, well if it can do that in one run that's pretty impressive. 
<jle`> it should do it in one run by default, and so could you :)
<jle`> sum = foldl (+) 0
<jle`> so, foldl (+) 0 (map (3*) [1,2,3])
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 0 (3 : map (3*) [2,3])
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 3 (map (3*) [2,3])  [02:37]
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 3 (6 : map (3*) [3])
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 9 (map (3*) [3])
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 9 (3 : map (3*) [])
<jle`>  = foldl (+) 12 (map (*3) []) = foldl (+) 12 [] = 12  [02:38]
<jle`> see, only one traversal :)
<jle`> just by manually expanding out the definition of foldl, you can see it
<jle`> oh, you'll probably also need to see how `map` is defined:
<jle`> @src map
<lambdabot> map _ []     = []
<lambdabot> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
<jle`> so map (*3) [1,2,3] = 3 : map (*3) [2,3]
<jle`> note that by manually evaluating foldl (+) 0 (map (*2) [1,2,3]) by pen
       and paper, the list is only traversed once  [02:39]
<qualiaqq> ah I get the map one
<jle`> note that this is not even a consequence of laziness
<jle`> it just comes from how foldl and map are defined
<qualiaqq> I'm still trying to understand the foldl implementation
<jle`> the relevant line is here:  [02:40]
<jle`> foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
<jle`> so, foldl (+) 0 (1:[2,3,4]) = foldl (+) (0 + 1) [2,3,4]
<jle`> foldl basically chomps the items in the list one-by-one and adds it to
       a running accumulator
<qualiaqq> i'm still learning, some of this is going over my head
<jle`> hm, do you know what that definition means?  [02:41]
<jle`> foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs ?
<jle`> do you know how pattern matching works?
<qualiaqq> I don't get what f and z are doing
<qualiaqq> I know how pattern matching works
<jle`> they're just "patterns"
<jle`> so, if i wanted to evaluate foldl (+) 0 (1:[2,3,4])
<jle`> then, f is matched as (+)
<jle`> z is matched as 0
<jle`> x is matched as 1, and xs is matched as [2,3,4]  [02:42]
<qualiaqq> i'm use to seeing x:xs but that one is more complex that what i've
           seen before
<jle`> yeah, this one takes three arguments
<jle`> so if i compared `foldl (+) 0 (1:[2,3,4])` to the definition of foldl
<xd1le> i.e. foldl takes 3 args
<jle`> i can see: f is (+), z is 0, x is 1, and xs is [2,3,4]
<jle`> do you see how they match up?
<qualiaqq> the function (+) matches to f just because f is first before x?
<jle`> foldl (+) 0 (1:[2,3,4])  [02:43]
<jle`> foldl  f  z (x:xs   )
<jle`> yeah, the first argument is called 'f', the second argument is called
       'z', etc.
<jle`> sort of like this:
<jle`> @let add x y = x + y
<lambdabot>  Defined.
<jle`> > add 1 2
<lambdabot>  3
<jle`> the first argument is matched as 'x', the second argument is matched as
       'y'
<jle`> and the answer is x + y
<jle`> in this case, x is 1, y is 2, and the answer is 1 + 2, or 3
<qualiaqq> @src foldl  [02:44]
<lambdabot> foldl f z []     = z
<lambdabot> foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
<qualiaqq> how to see the type of foldl?
<jle`> :t foldl
<lambdabot> Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
<jle`> or well, the type there is different than the src
<jle`> foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
<jle`> for lists
*** Hunter- (~Hunter_bo@172.98.67.72) is now known as Hunter_
<qualiaqq> oic
<jle`> so, the first argument, (+) is called 'f'  [02:45]
<jle`> just like in `add 1 2`, the first argument, 1, is called 'x'
<jle`> the second argument, 0, is called 'z'
<jle`> just like in 'add 1 2', the second argument, 2, is called 'y'
<jle`> the third argument has a specific pattern: (x:xs); so if i pass in
       (1:[2,3,4]), then x is 1, and xs is [2,3,4]
<jle`> just like how it works for the definition of 'map'
<qualiaqq> cool, I think I get it now  [02:46]
<qualiaqq> I was just reading this:
           http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures/01-intro.html
<jle`> so, if you wanted to evaluate foldl (+) 0 (1:[2,3,4])
<qualiaqq> which someone recommended to me about a week ago
<jle`> that'd be foldl (+) (0 + 1) [2,3,4]  [02:47]
<xd1le> qualiaqq: yes that's good
<jle`> because foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
<qualiaqq> it contrast a for loop
*** kadoban (~mud@unaffiliated/kadoban) has quit: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
<xd1le> qualiaqq: (the link)
<jle`> but yeah, practice evaluating simple folds like foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3],
       and you'll see why foldl (+) 0 (map (*2) [1,2,3]) naturally only
       traverses the list once
<jle`> even for a strict language like ocaml  [02:48]
<qualiaqq> it contrast a for loop that loops over a list and inside the loop
           it does acc = acc + 3 * lst[i];
<qualiaqq> I like how the functional language abstracts out the idea of *3 and
           summing the result  [02:49]
<jle`> yeah, it's pretty nice :)
<jle`> a lot of languages offer these sorts of approaches too
<qualiaqq> I was reading a book called Refactoring, I think by Kent Beck
<qualiaqq> he talks about breaking down for loops to do one thing even if you
           have to loop over it twice  [02:50]
<qualiaqq> for the purpose of abstraction
<qualiaqq> seems like haskell has the best of both worlds. abstraction without
           having to sacrifice on speed.
<jle`> yeah :)
<jle`> actually i lied, i think the one-traversal thing is only true because
       of laziness, maybe  [02:51]
<xd1le> qualiaqq: if you really want low level, but abstraction, see rust
<jle`> so yeah, laziness lets abstractions "compose"
<jle`> which is nice
<xd1le> i.e. "zero-cost abstraction" (in rust that is)
<jle`> laziness is what allows us to talk about things like map (3*) and sum
       and let them "work together"
<qualiaqq> xd1le, i've heard of that, i'll have to check it out one day
<qualiaqq> jle`, that's interesting, I never thought of that  [02:52]
<qualiaqq> jle`, i've been wondering what all the benefits of laziness are.
<jle`> yeah, this comes to bite you when you are working in strict languages
       like ocaml and scala
<jle`> you have all these nice abstractions but they don't compose
<jle`> because of lack of laziness
<jle`> sometimes i take these things for granted, heh  [02:53]
<xd1le> jle`: is this the same with idris?
<qualiaqq> jle`,  is strict the opposite of lazy?
<qualiaqq> i.e. it evals right away
<jle`> i don't do much idris in practice so i'm not sure
<xd1le> okay no worries
<jle`> qualiaqq: strict vs non-strict is a question of semantics, what things
       "mean"
<jle`> qualiaqq: laziness is a way to implement non-strict semantics
<jle`> there are presumably other ways  [02:54]
<jle`> strict is supposed to mean that, when you evaluate a function, all of
       its arguments are evaluated no matter what
<jle`> non-strict is when you can evaluate the result of a function and
       potentially not evaluate all of its arguments
*** jxm_ (~jxm@LAubervilliers-656-1-236-174.w193-248.abo.wanadoo.fr) has
    joined channel #haskell-beginners  [02:55]
<jle`> for a classic example of non-strictness in action:
<jle`> > const 1 (sum [1..])
<lambdabot>  1
<qualiaqq> interesting
<jle`> with strict semantics, to evaluate the result of 'const', you'd
       evaluate both 1 and sum [1..]
<qualiaqq> I think I ran into this when I was fooling around with a
           implementation of merge sort in haskell
<jle`> but haskell is non-strict, so the result can be found without
       evaluating sum [1..]
<qualiaqq> I was having a hard time getting it to actually sort because I
           wasn't using the sorted list haha  [02:56]
<jle`> if you tried implementing 'const' in a strict language like ocaml or
       javascript or java etc., you'll run into this difference right away
<jle`> heh
<qualiaqq> perhaps you can look at the code.
<jle`> feel free to post it :)
<qualiaqq> I thought it was working.. then I ran it on my laptop the other day
           and it stack overflowed on me  [02:57]
<jle`> hm, what ghc are you using?
<qualiaqq> I must of screwed up the tail recursion. 
<jle`> usually we don't talk about 'tail recursion' in haskell
<qualiaqq> 7.8.4
<jle`> because the term doesn't really have too much meaning as it is normally
       intended
<jle`> you might have just accidentally written an infinite loop
<jle`> eg, recursion without a base case  [02:58]
<xd1le> jle`: and it should be optimized anyway right?
<xd1le> as in tco
<jle`> the idea of 'tail call optimization' doesn't really have too much
       meaning, the way haskell works
<jle`> how would you apply 'tco' to foldl (+) 0, as demonstrated above?
*** Rizy (~Rizy@36.70.72.107) has quit: Quit: Rizy
<jle`> TCO is an optimization involving squishing down call stacks, but
       haskell doesn't have a call stack
<xd1le> oh nice  [02:59]
<xd1le> that makes sense
<xd1le> so qualiaqq must have done an infinite loop then or somethign?  [03:00]
<jle`> potentially
<qualiaqq> http://lpaste.net/151787
<xd1le> oh i see you said that
<jle`> that's sort of the problem with explicit recursion
<jle`> and using recursion in general
<jle`> it's easy to accidentally write infinite loops, heh
<qualiaqq> I didn't really write all that myself, took most of it from here:
           http://en.literateprograms.org/Merge_sort_(Haskell) and managed to
           screw it up when playing with it  [03:01]
<jle`> sort of like using GOTO in imperative languages
<qualiaqq> same goes for this insertion sort implementation
           http://lpaste.net/151788
<qualiaqq> I was timing how long it takes to sort n things  [03:02]
<jle`> hm, oh, so the implementation does work  [03:04]

*** seangrove (~user@c-50-174-77-118.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<jle`> "stack overflows" in haskell are actually heap overflows ... just
       unfortunately named, heh
<jle`> those usually happen when you don't have enough strictness, so there's
       a balance you have to find  [03:05]
<qualiaqq> Yea I was reading something about "making it more strict"
<xd1le> what does "go" do?  [03:06]
<qualiaqq> I mean on my desktop I can merge sort a very large number of
           elements, but on my laptop it overflows at like 10000
<jle`> mhm, that's sort of an art you have to learn when using haskell.
       laziness can help performance and space usage in a lot of situations,
       and can hurt in others
<jle`> the art is finding the right balance, when and where it's useful, etc.
<jle`> qualiaqq: are you compiling both with optimizations?  [03:07]

           function.

<xd1le> ghcjs is great
<jle`> and backend i've sort of tried new things every time
<jle`> but for non-consumer applications like protocol web servers i usually
       just use websockets and normal haskell stuff  [03:59]
<jle`> as in, non-http web stuff
<jle`> yes ghcjs is great :)
<prati> what do you write in for paying the bills ?
<qualiaqq> jle`,  I'm thinking of getting into machine learning or AI, I guess
           I should decide b/c I graduate this fall with a bs in cs.
<Roelof> jle`:  oke. IM now doing the Haskell book and thinking to make a
         financial app after that  so just be curious what people use   [04:00]
<prati> jle`  what do you write in for paying the bills ?
<jle`> haskell, woo hoo :D
<jle`> but i don't want to rub it in anyone's faces  [04:01]
<prati> jle` Nice to hear that :)  Considering Erik Meijer is writing PHP for
        paying the bills
<jle`> yes i know not a lot of people get the opportunity :)  [04:02]
<jle`> er, s/:)/:(
<Roelof> I do not think Haskell will pay for me the bills. I do not think
         there are haskell jobs in the Netherlands :(   [04:03]
<jle`> you can start by convincing people to let you use haskell :3  [04:05]
<jle`> qualiaqq: the !'s are strictness annotations, meaning that *before* you
       begin evaluating the result of merge (!x:xs) (!y:ys) = ..., evaluate x
       and y first
<jle`> hm, it's either before, or while  [04:06]
<jle`> maybe it's "when"
<jle`> but it might not help here

<qualiaqq> jle`,  this is sort of interesting, merge sort on my machine with
           that implementation took 0.444 seconds before and 0.216 seconds
           with the new compiler version and -O2 flags.
<prati> I will wait for you two to finish 
<qualiaqq> jle`, I mean merge sort on 100k random numbers.
<jle`> ah, so it did help  [04:09]
<qualiaqq> yep
<jle`> wait, the stricntess annotations helped?
<qualiaqq> haskell compiles so fast, why not just always optimize?
<jle`> or just -O2 and ghc-7.10.3 alone?

<jle`> yeah it fails at runtime because it's non-exaustive pattern match
<jle`> but these things aren't preferablle in real code
<jle`> the better thing would just be to use the Maybe (a -> a -> a) as it is
<prati> non-exaustive pattern match ?
<jle`> yeah, it's a pattern match where not all of the cases are handled
                                                                        [04:18]

<jle`> that's sort of the whole point of a type system -- to enforce logic

<xeorex> addMe x y = x + y       -- The equal is a bit counter intuitive when

      really isn't, it's a definition  [07:56]

<MarcelineVQ> dibblego: Yes I still need to do that as well, he's referring to
              the tic-tac-toe project from nicta you should try out before you
              make a game Lokathor
<Lokathor> ah, does it demonstrate some key insight?  [17:15]
<dibblego> usng types for API design
<MarcelineVQ> At the time it was a bit overwhelming because I had to make
              choices about how to represent things and my knowlege of data
              was pretty shakey
<MarcelineVQ> Probably still is, should be fun
<Lokathor> "types for API design"  [17:16]
<Lokathor> sounds quite interesting
<dibblego> provide an API such that the game of tic-tac-toe can be played and
           nothing more (i.e. try to break the game rules -> type error)
<MarcelineVQ> Lokathor: it should be very relevant because in games you want
              to keep components pretty seperated typically, to narrow down
              error-spaces and to make it easier to add or change components.
              So defining api's goes a long way, for example if you have an
              api for your renderer, you can use opengl or directx in the same
              way because your game can be agnostic about what it's drawing
              with. That's more advanced than a person needs   [17:20]
<MarcelineVQ> to think about a lot of the time but it's a good example
<Lokathor> hmm  [17:21]
<Lokathor> so like a sort of, doAction :: GameAction -> GameState ->
           (RenderableOutput,GameState)
<MarcelineVQ> If you find you like the idea you can look at servant later as
              well, it's all about cleverly typechecking api's  [17:22]

<Hunter_> its one of the hardes language to learn right?
<boj> Hunter_: not really
<boj> Hunter_: if you come from an imperative programming background you do
      tend to have to unlearn a few things first  [20:26]
<conal> boj: that's the implementation/operation. the continuous flow gets
        sampled discretely. just like sampling infinite data structures at a
        finite subset of its information.
<Hunter_> ok :) i will give it a look tonight i just installed xmonad and
          haskell platfors and dependencies :)
<Hunter_> i come prom python and ruby lol
<Hunter_> from*
<Lokathor> conal, i read a little of your suggested papers!
<conal> boj: continuous time & space makes for much better modularity. simple,
        precise semantics with correct, useful properties.  [20:27]

<boj> conal: man, way to ruin some light joking :D

<boj> Hunter_: as bitemyapp likes to say, the best way to get Haskell used is
      push it for some internal project at $DAY_JOB
<conal> boj: hard to tell. a lot of programmers really do believe that
        discrete time is somehow natural or even necessary. :/

<Hunter_> thanks for the awnser guys  [20:30]
<conal> boj: glad to hear it. the discrete assumption runs deep in
        programmers, i guess because they've been programmed by imperative
        languages.
<conal> "Language etches the grooves through which your thoughts must flow." -
        Noam Chomsky
<conal> Lokathor: i ran into a few bugs in GHC's run-time system.  [20:31]
<Lokathor> conal, i think that most people come from the idea that a game or
           other program operates with a core loop :: Input -> State ->
           (DisplayedOutput,NextState)
<Lokathor> er, well, NextState = state, but you get the idea

<Lokathor> conal, so would you say that reactive is in a good state to use
           despite these GHC runtime issues?
<Lokathor> can particular functions just be avoided or something? or should a

      you aimed for the closest?

<Lokathor> i heard one advice about how you should learn Elm, use their FRP
           system, and then come back and learn a Haskell FRP system.
<Lokathor> bitemyapp, due to some implicit advice from you, i re-arranged my
           article on State to prompt the user to try figuring it out
           themelves a lot more

<x393> if ghcjs was a bit more stack-friendly i might give it more of a try...
<Lokathor> ah, my thing actually uses stack, based on an example that ReinH

<x393> except it doesn't look like butt because it's a web UI instead of a
       klunky native desktop app.
<Lokathor> in my specific case, I want to write STM things, write tests for
           them, but to run them I need to use atomically, which turns the STM
           into an IO  [21:59]

<Lokathor> hexchat  [22:07]
<Lokathor> emacs

<vilasopher> I mean it is but it's text based
<MarcelineVQ> you may be thinking of gui, and gui can still be text based
<x393> text editor already counts for 66% of those examples =P
<Lokathor> vilasopher, hexchat is beyond the ability of a person asking the
           question "how do you UI in haskell?" to solve on their own. that's
           why they're asking
<Lokathor> so it's a legitimate response
<vilasopher> ah my bad  [22:08]
<Lokathor> gpodder (a podcast program), MUSHclient, PDF-XChange, putty,
           windows explorer, cmd.exe
<Lokathor> i'm literally just looking at programs that happen to be on my

<vilasopher> I use eclipse for my job/classes  [22:09]
<x393> cmd.exe? cmon you're reaching!
<x393> exporer??
<Lokathor> in my systray: Skype, dropbox, Pidgin, Google Music Manager, GOG
           Galaxy, Steam
<x393> i mean, sure i've got my niche use cases
<x393> like audio production software
<vilasopher> arent there some video games made with haskell? surely that
             counts  [22:10]
<x393> but for a beginner, i think their visual-thingy production oriented
       tendencies are probably more productively geared to webdev
<flounders> I'm using Thunderbird, Evince, pavucontrol (as needed), Mumble
            (it's ui could use improvement).
<Lokathor> lately i've also used MSPaint, Dolphin (the GCN emulator), a Diablo
           1 mod, VLC, A game helper program called "KOL Mafia" which is
           written using Swing for the core UI  [22:11]
<x393> vilasopher i wish ... if only there was more a story there. some
       college student wrote a quake 3 clone in like 2005
<x393> and then like there's been no other productivity in like 10 years
<x393> as far as gamedev goes. i don't understand it. someone made quake 3
       clone, some other dude did mario
<Lokathor> x393, i think haskell UI is only "most productive towards web dev"
           because the non-web dev in haskell is reallllllly crap for most
           people right now
<Lokathor> not because non-web is itself crap
<vilasopher> :(
<MarcelineVQ> it's because there's more support for other languages x393, see
              gamedev.stackexchange for example  [22:12]
<x393> then in the 10 years since there's been like 1 breakout app. in spite
       of all the improvements to the language/compiler/ecosystem
<x393> i really don't get it
<MarcelineVQ> boj has an interesting project going on though
              http://armoredbits.com/
<MarcelineVQ> Mind you haskell is the backend
<x393> marcelineVQ what do you mean by support, other languages have mroe of a
       gamedev ecosystem?  [22:13]
<Lokathor> x393, a major factor that you're perhaps not considering is that
           most people that program games want to program games so that they
           can *work at a game programming company*
<x393> (i'd agree with that mostly)
<Lokathor> such companies really only work in C++ or C# or similar, so if you
           want to work at that kind of company, programming in haskell is
           building up the wrong sort of expertise
<x393> lokathor lots of people want to do game dev for fun. look at the whole
       ludum dare culture
<MarcelineVQ> x393: a bit, but it's more like more people know how to solve
              the promblem you might run into because it's been done a million
              times
<Lokathor> i'm not saying no one wants to make a game in haskell (*points at
           self*), i'm saying that most people that set out to learn have
           eventual goals that override simply picking haskell  [22:14]
<x393> i think it is partially a cultural thing. i mean if someone had written
       something comparable to the Love engine
<MarcelineVQ> And tutorials are written for c# and C++ and java, etc
<x393> there'd probably  be a rich indie game scene in haskell. unfortunately
       category theorists aren't going to spend their time on that
<x393> i'd settle for a game dev scene comparable to what javascript or even
       lua has  [22:15]
<Lokathor> Haskell also suffers from bit rot a whole lot more than other
           langauges i've used in the past
<MarcelineVQ> evolve or die(tm)
<x393> lokathor oh so it's not my imagination. that's super frustrating,
       especially as a beginner not knowing which package is the "right" one

<Lokathor> just earlier i asked about what FRP library to use for making a
           game, the answer was "none of the ones that currently work are
           actually FRP in the first place"
<Lokathor> they're just "FRP-like"
<x393> sometimes i feel like hackage is like javascript ecoysstem but worse...
       if it hasn't been updated in 6 months, it's probably dead  [22:17]
<x393> except javascript has a critical mass of devs to keep picking up
       libraries or replacing them
<x393> whereas with haskell there's just a big gap sitting there for months or
       years...
<x393> lokathor: isn't reflex the right answer? everyone says it's the most
       performance-y one  [22:18]
<x393> of course, like everything else haskell, it's a "solution exists, time
       to go home" type of answer... IN THEORY it would work great but nobody
       has actually done it
<MarcelineVQ> stack solves that to a point, because the lts your package is
              built with doens't change over time
<Lokathor> sure, seems solid, but it's not technically FRP, it's just FRP
           inspired, or some distinction like that
<MarcelineVQ> If it works now it should continue working
<Lokathor> i'm not saying you can't use it  [22:19]
<x393> well im not a purist aboutfrp personally
<x393> ill leave that  to conal
<Lokathor> nor am i :P
<x393> if its good for game writing and im writing a game, welll tjen...
<Lokathor> but perhaps you see my broader point about how bit rot sorta hits
           haskell a lot
<Lokathor> stack will probably help a lot, but it has to phase in and such
                                                                        [22:20]
<x393> yeah i like stack
<x393> like, dude, what the hell happened to helm
<Lokathor> i still see a lot of repos on git with cabal install advice and no
           stack.yaml file
<x393> it had a snazzy website and all these beginners thought it'd be the
       cool haskell game engine
<x393> but no... it's pretty much dead  [22:21]
<x393> yeah, stack has some gaps
<x393> but they're getting filled in

<nitrix> x393: I think the learning curve for haskell is too high for game
         developers.
<nitrix> I'm actually very serious.
<x393> nitrix don't believe that. in some ways, game devs are superior devs
                                                                        [22:28]
<x393> in some ways they're backwards yes
<nitrix> We see value in code being correct; game developers generally get
         their kick from just "seeing it work", and quickly.
<bitemyapp> I think that's only true due to unfamiliarity and people telling
            new devs to bling out.
<nitrix> x393: You're confused, it's not about who's superior.
<x393> but i don't believe that you can make a blanket statement about their
       ability to tackle a learning curve  [22:29]
<x393> nitrix maybe UNITY game devs
<nitrix> I just think the benefits of haskell might not be as obvious to a
         game developer.
<x393> nitrix but serious game devs are willing to pay a high cost for
       _efficiently_ obtaining correctness
<x393> part of the appeal of haskell for me IS fast turnaround  [22:30]
<asnyx> Some game developers, I'm sure would be perfectionists. I think its
        not the category but the experience that reflects the learning curve
        for a language like Haskell. Those with imperative experience will
        have a harder time than those who are starting Haskell as their first
        language, I think.
<x393> with the repl driven development + compiler automating development
       effort
<x393> + of course HM type inference (but that's a smaller win)
<x393> overall the appeal of haskell for me is development efficiency in
       exchanged for a upfront fixed learning cost  [22:31]
<nitrix> That's called a learning curve.
<x393> yeah, and good devs (game dev or otherwise) are willing to pay it in
       exchange for long term efficiency  [22:32]

<x393> my point is that the gains in haskell are short term, the learning
       curve is a one time cost. the value proposition is that you can get
       better short term efficiency once you've paid it
<Lokathor> nitrix, if the game dev oriented people i've seen or talked
           directly with are any indication, the biggest haskell issue is a
           lack of closeness to the metal  [22:35]
<x393> well, given haskell adoption, you could make that statement about the
       ENTIRETY of the software engineering profession, not just gamedev
<nitrix> Lokathor: People loose credibility in my book the moment they mention
         terms like those.
<x393> in any field, it's going to be a few weirdos at this point. there's
       going to need to be a generational shift to be honest.
<nitrix> Lokathor: "to the metal" ...  [22:36]
<x393> hopefully we don't lose the next generation to python and javascript =/
<Lokathor> nitrix, i'm including people with a great deal of game design
           experience
<Lokathor> john carmack notably gave a talk where he pointed out that FP is
           really good, and more people should try to use it, but then
           basically said that you should try to do FP in C++
<Lokathor> and i was like "wait no"
<x393> nitrix respect your experiences, but i think what youre saying could
       apply to all dev industries, you just happened to be in gamedev  [22:37]

<nitrix> https://github.com/nitrix/lspace/blob/haskell/src/Main.hs
<bitemyapp> there are some harder, nastier constraints in gamedev that make
            using Haskell less nice. AAA is probably out. Indie is in the
            cards though.
<x393> anyone doing haskell right now is playing a long game that's somewhat
       oppositional to their institution

<nitrix> Are there many libraries that's like lens?  [22:46]

<bitemyapp> a few, but lens is the best.

<bitemyapp> x393: but there just isn't enough labor that has the capacity to
            move the needle right now. Much of the more experienced folk are
            chasing...other things.
<x393> bitemyapp i know, but i wish it were faster. need it to be 5-8 years
       more evolved, today :P
<nitrix> I mean, not in what they do, but in how complex the types become.
<bitemyapp> complex?
<bitemyapp> lens is not that complex.
<nitrix> Traversals :/
<x393> bitemyapp what's that? be more fancy type system stuff?
<bitemyapp> it's a pure profunctor model with some applicative/traversable
            structure slapped on top.
<x393> bitemyapp i'm reading your book and i don't think i know what a
       profunctor is yet.  [22:47]
<bitemyapp> Traversals are just very general and unspecific, not very
            complicated.
<bitemyapp> I'm not saying it's trivial for a beginner to learn but complex is
            something else.
<nitrix> bitemyapp: I see. Well, granted I managed to write my own lenses
         (without template haskell), I assume it means I have a decent
         understanding.  [22:48]
<nitrix> But it still took me like a good 3-4 hours to wrap my head around it.

<nitrix> And in those 4 hours, I sure was worried that I'd stumble on similar
         libraries.
* bitemyapp pauses to think
<x393> nitrix i think 3-4 hours to achieve lens understanding is above par
<bitemyapp> there are libraries that can make you thrash like that, but none
            of them are nearly as nice/vital as lens.  [22:49]
<bitemyapp> you have to learn to eschew bling.
<bitemyapp> until you've got other things nailed down.

<prati> I have one question, you can execute code in two ways    [06:18]
<prati> 1) Compile the code to machine code, let the machine run it directly
<prati> 2) Use Haskell/other programming language, for ex: like parsec,  or
        something like this
        http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/extras/05-type-classes/ExprT.hs
<prati> What are some difference, advantages and disadvantages with either
        approach ?
*** takle (~takle@cpc73668-dals20-2-0-cust505.20-2.cable.virginm.net) has
    joined channel #haskell-beginners
<jedai> prati: that's "compiling" vs "interpreting"  [06:20]
*** sathish_haskell (~sathish_h@75.143.16.8) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<jedai> prati: that's an old distinction, that's blurred in some cases : many
        modern interpreters start by "compiling" the code to bytecode, a
        simpler representation, that's kinda like machine code, except not
        your physical machine.  [06:22]
<prati> jedai Yes, 
<prati> what is the workflow in writing compilers ?
<jedai> Also the JIT compilers (Just-In-Time) interpret the language but to
        execute it they translate into machine code fragments they then reuse
<prati> i undrestand a bit for interpreter from perspective of Haskell 
                                                                        [06:23]
<prati> **understand
<gavinhughes> Why is this:
<gavinhughes> mTh x y z = x * y * z
<jedai> prati: A compiler start by * parsing the language
<prati> for parsing language, Do they use 
<jedai> then * optimizing the intermediate representation (that can be very
        complicated)
<prati> Bison ?
<prati> YAAC ?
<gavinhughes> typed as a -> a -> a -> a
<jedai> and finally * outputting the machine code
<prati> I mean any of them ?
<gavinhughes> But this mTh = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z  [06:24]
<jedai> prati: Parsec can be used as well
<gavinhughes> Is typed as Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer
<prati> okay, the parser is common between both ?
<jedai> prati: the parsing library/tool does not impact the rest of the
        process
*** sathish_haskell (~sathish_h@75.143.16.8) has quit: Ping timeout: 240
    seconds
<jedai> prati: You generally use the same parser for interpreting or compiling
        (if you have both like Haskell)  [06:25]
<prati> For compiler, once it is parsed what is the work flow ?
<jedai> gavinhughes: This is monomorphism restriction
<prati> where does LLVM fit in ?
<jedai> gavinhughes: for historical reasons, when an expression "doesn't look
        like a function" Haskell try/tried to attribute it a monomorphic (no
        type variables) type  [06:26]
<jedai> prati: the llvm is one of the backend
<prati> Does the parser has to generate to LLVM frontend ?
<jedai> prati: that is one of the part that emits machine code
<prati> for compilation ?
<jedai> prati: from the perspective of GHC  [06:27]
<jedai> prati: GHC parse and optimize the Haskell code, it then generates llvm
        code that llvm optimize again and compile to machine code
<gavinhughes> @jedai This first is typed Num  [06:28]
<lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
<jedai> prati: that normally gives pretty good results since GHC can perform
        the high-level optimization while LLVM is very good at low-level
        optimization
<prati> if we blackbox LLVM as interpreter, then from GHC perspective it is
        interpreter ?
<jedai> gavinhughes: Num is a "Typeclass"
<gavinhughes> How does it infer Integer on the second?  If this is
              complicated, can you direct me to a discussion?
<gavinhughes> ahh.. right.  [06:29]
<prati> ** from GHC perspective, it only has to generate what LLVM
        understands, 
<jedai> @info MonomorphismRestriction
<lambdabot> MonomorphismRestriction
<jedai> gavinhughes: Well... anyways "Num a => a -> a-> a" means that "a" may
        be any type, as long as this type is an instance of Num (that means
        that you can use (+) (*) (-)... on it)  [06:30]
<jedai> gavinhughes: so it is polymorphic since you can use it for different
        types (even if this is restricted by the typeclass)  [06:31]
<jedai> gavinhughes: "Integer -> Integer -> Integer" is monomorphic, it can
        only be used with Integer  [06:32]
<jedai> gavinhughes: the Integer is chosen by GHC(i) by a process known as
        defaulting where the compiler try to find a monomorphic type that
        works by trying a list of type in order and stopping with the first
        that fit  [06:33]
<jedai> prati: GHC use llvm as a compiler though. The GHC compiling via LLVM
        process is like that : Haskell code --> GHC --> llvm code --> LLVM -->
        Machine code (executable, OS specific)  [06:36]
<prati> Okay, It makes sense 
<gavinhughes> @jedai  OK.  So by removing the arguments and giving them as
              functions causes Haskell to do this process, rather than leave
              the args polymorphic?  [06:37]
<lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
<jedai> prati: Of course I'm simplifying here but that's the overall process
<pjdelport> gavinhughes: You should probably address people without the @,
            otherwise lambdabot is going to try and interpret it as a command
            every time. :)
<prati> so, parsec can be used for to generate code for LLVM 
<pjdelport> (@ is lambdabot's command prefix)
<gavinhughes> pjdelport.. thanks.  [06:38]
<jedai> gavinhughes: basically if you write "something = ..." it doesn't look
        like a function to the compiler and it will try to make it monomorphic
        (though that can be deactivated and probably will be by default in the
        future)
<prati> What are some major use cases for parsec ? 
<prati> 1) Type Checker ?  [06:39]
<prati> 2) DSL ?
<jedai> prati: Parsec is used to parse someting, you can use it to generate
        any format you wish, whether it be an immediate interpretation or an
        intermediate datastructure (a syntax tree)
<prati> jedai okay  [06:40]
<jedai> prati: only once you have this intermediate structure can it be type
        checked, or executed or compiled or optimized, but that's not really
        parsec work
<prati> yes

<prati> x can be Integer 
<jedai> prati: anything else ?
<prati> One moment
<jedai> prati: Don't search too much, it can't have any other form...  [06:49]
*** thc202 (~thc202@unaffiliated/thc202) has joined channel #haskell-beginners
<prati> Yes, It can't have any other form
<prati> I have written ( getInteger _ ) because
<jedai> prati: so your first equation "getInteger (IntegerVal i) = i" is
        always executed
<prati> If it is of any other type other than Val, I want to return 0  [06:50]
<jedai> so the second equation never happens, so it tells you the patterns
        overlap because anything that match your second pattern would already
        have matched the first, so the second equation is useless  [06:51]
<prati> Ah, A function can only accept one type, but can accept different data
        constructors
<jedai> prati: Haskell is strongly typed, you don't need to write an equation
        for when you give another type to the function since this won't even
        compile
<jedai> rather "statically typed"  [06:52]
<prati> jedai Yes, 
<jedai> prati: Yes. though a polymorphic function could accept different type
<prati> polymorphic function ?   [06:53]
<jedai> prati: simple example : "id x = x"
<jedai> @type id
<lambdabot> a -> a
<prati> Ah, Got it !
<prati> coming from java, I am calling that as Generic type, I should improve
        my terminology !  [06:54]
<jedai> prati: Note how the "a" is lowercase whereas a type name always start
        with a uppercase ? That's because it's a type variable, it can have
        any type vlaue
<jedai> prati: Right, those are Generics in Java
<jedai> prati: though you can't do introspection so you can't do anything with
        a value of type "a", except returns it like in "id"  [06:56]
<jedai> prati: of course there are mechanism to be able to do more, as long as
        the type is more restricted  [06:57]

        similar to Java)  
<jedai> prati: Right you can't, at runtime, all types are erased
<mniip> yes, there are far less things you can do with values of unknown types
                                                                        [06:58]
<mniip> which in turn means parametricity is more powerful
<jedai> prati: but see "head", though you can't do anything to the elements of
        the list, you can still pattern match the list to return the first
        element
<jedai> @type (^)  [06:59]
<lambdabot> (Integral b, Num a) => a -> b -> a
<prati> yes
<jedai> prati: And anticipating a fair bit, you can also restrict the type
        variables only to types that implements certain operations (think
        interfaces in Java though this is more powerful in reality)
<prati> yes, typeclasses  [07:00]
*** seangrov` (~user@c-50-174-77-118.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<jedai> prati: for instance here, you can put any number of type "a" to an
        integral power of type "b"
<prati> so that I can invoke those operations, regardless of the underlying
        type ?
<prati> underlying type variable which is implementing ?  [07:01]
<jedai> prati: Right, as long as the underlying type has been made an instance
        of the right typeclass
<prati> Is it similar to runtime polymorphism ? 
<jedai> prati: It is compile time though, and often optimized away at complite
        time
<jedai> so no  [07:02]
<prati> because it infers the type, from the caller of the function ?
<jedai> prati: Right
<prati> What I don't understand is, 
<prati> in Java also, when you have a function accepting a interface, the
        caller of the function has to be implementing that interface,   [07:03]
<prati> which is enforced at compile time !
<prati> The thing I don't understand is, How haskell is different here ?
                                                                        [07:04]

<jedai> tekkkz: Yes, I know the problem... Some people have plenty of ideas,
        stole some of them ! You can help with some hackage libraries, ton of
        them have open issues or insufficient documentation, find one that
        interest you. Or just keep looking, recently I wrote a tiny script
        that reads a list of choices with weight and randomly pick some of
        them (according to the wieghts)  [07:43]
<jedai> as well as a program that created the list starting from a pretty
        dirty csv file.
<tekkkz> can you explain the script about the weight more detailed please, I
         don't understand what you mean ...  [07:44]
<jedai> tekkkz: Not really important, just an exemple for me. Basically I have
        a list of items (pupils for me) with weights and pick 5 of them. But I
        want the probability of picking one to be proportional to the weight
        (so a 0.5 is twice less likely to be picked than a 1)  [07:46]
<_rgn> basically weighted random?
<jedai> _rgn: right, the script is super simple (5 lines, most of them dealing
        with IO)  [07:47]
<tekkkz> okay, i understand what you mean. when im done with some more
         chapters, im starting to try something - next to the book - by
         myself. just little stuff like you explained ... :D
<jedai> _rgn: And I had to write a script to generate the initial weighted
        list of pupils given a bad csv file of notes  [07:48]

<tippeneinn> How would I restrict a data type to integers in range [0..6] ?

<tippeneinn> data DayIndex = 0 | 1 | .. etc
<tippeneinn> I have a case statement complaining about non-exhaustive pattern
             matching  [13:22]
<pjdelport> tippeneinn: It depends how "properly" you want to do that, and how
            strong you want the type-level guarantees to be.  [13:24]
<pjdelport> If you just want to address the warning, but are happy to have the
            function be partial, you can have a catch-all case that produces
            an error message.  [13:25]
<pjdelport> If you want it to be more proper, you can use a custom data type,
            or a newtype wrapper.  [13:26]
<pjdelport> But actually, if you want to represent days, rather than restrict
            integers, you'd probably want something like data DayOfWeek = Mon
            | Tue | ...

<tippeneinn> well, I'm well, I'm mapping timestamps to Dotw enums, so the
             integer mapping is 1 thru 6 from the toModifiedJulianDay  [13:28]
<tippeneinn> http://lpaste.net/151840  [13:29]
<tippeneinn> I could make the catch-all case but that makes it look like it's
             a possible scenario
<pjdelport> Ah, that looks about right.  [13:30]
<pjdelport> You can handle the catch-all in two ways: either say error
            "Invalid input: ...", or return a Maybe DOTW  [13:31]
<pjdelport> You might want both.
<pjdelport> The function that returns a Maybe DOTW you would use when you
            might actually expect invalid input to be handled, like when
            you're dealing with user input.  [13:32]
<pjdelport> The one that just results in the error message you would use when
            you're dealing with integers that should already be valid (e.g.
            trusted values coming from the library), where you do want your
            program to crash if something weird happens.  [13:33]
<tippeneinn> sure, these functions all take UTCTime as input tho, so there's
             no way to input invalid integers  [13:34]
<tippeneinn> that's why I wanted timestampIndex to be UTCTime -> DayIndex
             where DayIndex is restricted to ints 0..6
<pjdelport> Have you looked at
            https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.6/docs/Data-Time-Calendar-WeekDate.html
            by the way?  [13:35]

<tekkkz> did a mistake
<tekkkz> it msut be: ++ (getWords . dropWhile (==' ') . dropWhile (/=' ') $

<tekkkz> and i forgot the ( ) around this all after the ++
<jedai> tekkkz: right, except "[] ++" is a no-op...  [15:03]
<tekkkz> what is no-op?
<jedai> tekkkz: it doesn't do anything
<tekkkz> oh
<jedai> [] ++ === id (on list)
<tekkkz> when i use ++ i dont need [] right?
<jedai> tekkkz: You don't need either, [] ++ xs === xs  [15:04]

<ReinH> bitemyapp: the annoying thing about Kontiki is the WAL is exactly the
        part you want someone to write *for* you. It's the hard part.  [16:19]
<ReinH> And Kontiki just assumes you have one and writes everything in terms

<kriztw> you have an implementation that technically satisfies the type, but
         it does the wrong thing with the values

         use the Seed resulting from the Gen a in the Gen b  [08:56]

<mchall> is this correct ? genTwo g f s = f (fst(s')) (snd s')
         where s' = g(mkSeed 1)  [08:58]
<kriztw> what you do is run the first generator with seed 1, take the return
         value and throw away the seed, and then use the "outer" seed for the
         Gen b
<kriztw> which isn't correct
<kriztw> it is closer, but there are still two issues
<kriztw> first, it is not good style to use fst and snd if you can avoid it,
         you should try to use pattern matching instead  [08:59]
<kriztw> fst and snd are usually only to be used as functions, e.g. to map
         over lists
*** merijn (~merijn@wcw-staff-145-18-165-250.wireless.uva.nl) has quit: Quit:
    leaving
<kriztw> secondly, now you don't use the initial seed for Gen a, but always
         use 1
<kriztw> there shouldn't be any hardcoded seeds in the genTwo definition, as
         it needs to work with all possible seeds and generators  [09:00]
<mchall> that is what I thought at the time
<kriztw> the way to avoid that is to wrap the entire body of the function in a
         lambda  [09:01]
<kriztw> that is, genTwo g f = (\s -> ... ), and as long as the dots have the
         type (b,Seed), then the body will have type Gen b  [09:02]
<kriztw> since Gen b is defined as Seed -> (b, Seed)

<mchall> yes please
<mchall> the lambda that you wrap the function body where does the s come from

<kriztw> the return type of genTwo :: Gen a -> (a -> Gen b) -> Gen b
<tekkkz> Hello! In the HaskellBook, chapter 9 (LISTS), at the chapter
         exercises, Number 7, squishAgain ... I don't understand what this

         why? What? Can someone explain me please what squishAgain should do.
         The task is on page 386 at version 0.9.2  [09:39]
<kriztw> is Gen b, and Gen a and (a -> Gen b) are the two arguments
<mchall> ok so far
*** galderz (~g@redhat/jboss/galderz) has quit: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
<kriztw> The type Gen b is just a type alias, which means Seed -> (b, Seed)

<kriztw> the s doesn't "come" from anywhere, it is part of the value, exactly
         like you need to write [1] to create a value of the list type
<kriztw> it's just a bit harder for the intuition when the value is a function

<kriztw> mchall: the first thing you should do inside the function is to apply
         your generator, g, to this seed, so you get a value of type a and a
         new seed  [09:43]
<mchall> genTwo g f = (\s -> g s )  [09:44]

<mchall> genTwo g f = (\s -> let r = g s in ...)  [09:45]

<kriztw> because g :: Gen a = Seed -> (a, Seed)   [09:47]
<mchall>  something like (a,_)  [09:49]
<kriztw> you need both, so (a, s')
<kriztw> then you can use f in the second part

<tekkkz> hm Ankhers i have no clue just gimme a tip/hint please  [15:14]
<Hiro`> Hey everyone, I'm doing the NICTA course and I'm currently writing a
        function to test that a list is greater than four.   [15:15]
<Hiro`> To do this, I first take the length of the list, then test if it is
        greater than four. Then I get a stack overflow, which surprised me.
<tekkkz> Ankhers, so i need to pass two values to the ordering function,x and
         y, right?
<Ankhers> Hiro`: length will not stop until it reaches the end of the list.
                                                                        [15:16]
<Ankhers> so length [1..] will never stop.

<Ankhers> tekkkz: Yes, you will need to pass both arguments to the function.
          The issue I pointed out, is when y > x, you never check y against
          the other items in the list.

<tekkkz> yeah, i fixed that now, like this: myMaximumBy f (x : y : xs) = if f
         x y == GT then x else myMaximumBy f (y : xs)
<Ankhers> Hiro`: Do you know how to take an arbitrary number of elements from
          the list?
<tekkkz> and now i need to handle the base case with one item left, right?
<Ankhers> tekkkz: Most likely. How can you check that?  [15:18]
<henk> hi, is there a simple way of showing intermediate results while running
       a function? I’m doing the monad challenges and wrote a beast of a
       'where'-block and need to get a better clue where the wrong value
       starts propagating …
<Ankhers> henk: You could move the functions out of the where clause.
<tekkkz> Ankhers, i have an idea, but what should i return if they arent GT ?

<Ankhers> henk: If it is just for debugging, I don't see the issue. Also, does
          it state that you have to do everything in a where clause?
<henk> Other idea: can I write type signatures for these intermediate results?
       Making the types of everything explicit would help me

<hexagoxel> henk: there is trace/traceShow/traceShowId from Debug.Trace. but

<MarcelineVQ> section 3.6 especially could be useful
<Hiro`> Here's my code
<MarcelineVQ> http://lpaste.net/  [15:54]
<Hiro`> It's pretty trivial to get a working implementation, what I don't

        forever rather than stopping once its done enough work
* Ankhers is invisible
<Hiro`> Sorry, the code: http://lpaste.net/151911
<MarcelineVQ> It can't do anything else, the thing that tells length when it's
              done is the empty list, which you can only get to by consuming
              the whole thing  [15:56]
<MarcelineVQ> The whole of infinity is pretty big :>
<Hiro`> But I don't need the length of the list, do I?

*** douglascorrea (~douglasco@191-247-230-40.3g.claro.net.br) has quit: Remote

<Hiro`> so the reason is that (> 4) is strict in its argument, whereas (take

*** montanonic (~nicholas@c-98-246-188-73.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined

<MarcelineVQ> if you're talking strictness it's because lenght is strict over
              the spine of a list  [15:58]
<MarcelineVQ> and take 5 is never larger than 5 so length can easily traverse
              it
<Hiro`> but if take 5 were strict it would never terminate  [15:59]
<Hiro`> irrespective of its eventual size
<Hiro`> (not that that affects length, in my implementation)
*** IrishPrime (~IrishPrim@74.202.224.66) has quit: Quit: Leaving  [16:00]
<Ankhers> I'm pretty sure take 5 would still terminate if it were strict.
                                                                        [16:01]
<Hiro`> why is length strict but in general its possible to work with infinite
        lists and right folds?
<MarcelineVQ> Hmm, I don't think take needs to be lazy to work here, you're
              just grabbing the first 5 things you see and stopping
*** baweaver (~baweaver@173.230.196.25) has joined channel #haskell-beginners
<Ankhers> length still isn't strict. It just needs to consume the entire list
          to know its length.
<Hiro`> Ankhers: if take 5 were not lazy, it would evaluate its argument, no?
        and that would burst the stack (if its argument were an infinite list)
                                                                        [16:02]
<Ankhers> Actually, I think you are right about that.  [16:03]
<Ankhers> maybe
<MarcelineVQ> singly-linked lists are looked at one element at a time, take 5
              does this 5 times, in a strict language it's not any different
              afaik
<MarcelineVQ> I mean ​I can follow 5 pointers in c and stop.
<MarcelineVQ> right folds pass control back and forth between the `foldr` and
              the f you give foldr, so the f has the chance to say "we're
              done, I got what I wanted, I don't need the next thing"
<MarcelineVQ> @src foldr  [16:04]
<lambdabot> foldr f z []     = z
<lambdabot> foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)
<emmanuel_erc> @src zipWith
<lambdabot> zipWith f (a:as) (b:bs) = f a b : zipWith f as bs
<lambdabot> zipWith _ _      _      = []
<emmanuel_erc> that's cool
<MarcelineVQ> `f x (foldr f z xs)` says do f to x and if we need another
              argument to f do (foldr f z xs)
<MarcelineVQ> But if you never look at the second argument you don't keep
              going.  [16:05]
<MarcelineVQ> @src ||
<Hiro`> MarcelineVQ: if I pass a function an argument in a language with
        strict evaluation, it will evaluate the argument and then substitute
        it in the body of the function. if that argument is an infinite
        data-structure, it won't finish evaluating it, so it will never get to
        the stage of executing its body
<lambdabot> True  || _ =  True
<lambdabot> False || x =  x
<Ankhers> What MarcelineVQ said is right. strictness isn't necessarily forcing
          the total evaluation of the functions arguments.
<MarcelineVQ> True doesn't even look at the second arguiment
<Hiro`> foldr is lazy in the list  [16:06]
<Hiro`> `||` is lazy in its second argument 
<Hiro`> it's not lazy in its first  [16:07]
<MarcelineVQ> That sounds right. Lazy is a tough term to talk about for me
              because it means something a little different depending who
              you're talking to.  [16:08]

<Hiro`> (map f infinity) can just return another infinite list, whereas
        (length infinity) has to produce a number
<nitrix> Correct.  [16:32]
<nitrix> @src map
<lambdabot> map _ []     = []
<lambdabot> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
<Hiro`> so (map f infinity) doesn't have to evaluate its argument *at all*
<Hiro`> potentially
<nitrix> Hiro`: Here you can see that map is a recursive definition of
         applications of f to x (and xs).
<Hiro`> (it's second argument, that is)
<ski> `map' is said to be incremental. you can get part of the output by
      looking only at part of the input. `length' otoh has to look at the
      whole input (more specifically, the whole "skeleton" of the list) to be
      able to produce any useful information. `length' could be said to be
      "bulky"  [16:33]
<Hiro`> nitrix: isn't the implementation of length also very similar?
<nitrix> Thus, in a lazy language, the list being infinite isn't an issue at
         all for the purpose of mapping a function to all the elements.
<ski> Hiro` : the difference is that `+' (in `length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs')
      is strict, while `:' in `map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs' is nonstrict
<Hiro`> ski: ah  [16:34]
<Hiro`> lightbulb
<nitrix> Hiro`: No, length will try to fold to count how many elements there
         is, and will never complete.
<Hiro`> I thought it was about numbers :)
<ski> Hiro` : thus, if you only want to look at the first element of the
      output of `map', the recursive call to `map' for the tail won't be
      performed (yet)

<Hiro`> ski: really?
<ski> Hiro` : if you only want to check whether the output list from `map' is
      empty or not, then the `f x' computation in `map f (x:xs) = f x : map f
      xs' won't be performed
<ski> > head (map (^ 2) [undefined,undefined,undefined])
<lambdabot>  *Exception: Prelude.undefined
<ski> > null (map (^ 2) [undefined,undefined,undefined])
<lambdabot>  False  [16:36]
<Hiro`> but if I want to construct a list, isn't the first argument to (:)
        evaluated?
<ski> no
<kadoban> Hiro`: No
<nitrix> It's not about (:).
<ski> it's only evaluated when you demand to "look" at that argument
<nitrix> Maybe thunks would be a useful intuition to him?  [16:37]
<Hiro`> I'm familiar with thunks
<Hiro`> I've written them in scheme etc
<kadoban> Hiro`: Look at ski's examples above. The 'null' one pretty much
          shows it doesn't care what's in the list unless you actually look.
<ski> if you type an expression into the interactor (like GHCi), then it will
      implicitly apply `print' to the result of evaluating the expression.
      `print' will call `show' to turn the result into a list of characters,
      and then it will demand to know which character each of them is, in
      order to perform the effect of actually printing them
<Hiro`> ski: but then is the same not true of length?  [16:38]
<ski> in general, it is only the act of demanding to know the actual
      characters to be printed here, that drives the entire computation
<Hiro`> ghci is in the IO monad, and it's not the same, that's okay 
<ski> Hiro` : what do you mean by "the same" ?  [16:39]
<Hiro`> it's not the general case
<Hiro`> that's what you were saying at [21.31].
<Hiro`> or so I thought
<ski> `length' and other "bulky" operations will insist to look at their whole
      input, before being able to provide any information regarding their
      result
<kadoban> Well, 'length' doesn't look at the elements, just the spine of the
          list.  [16:40]
<ski> `map' and other "incremental" operations can compute parts of their
      output without having to look at all their input

<ski> i suppose the distinction "bulky" vs. "incremental" is used when you
      have a potential for unbounded repetition, like an arbitrary number of
      cons-cells in a list, before the end (empty list) (or even no end, an
      infinite list). an operation that is bulky in a list must necessarily
      fail when passed an infinite list. an incremental operation can happily
      continue computing parts of the result at a time

<Hiro`> you just get back another 'thunk'  [16:48]

<ski> Hiro` : yes, for types like `Int',`Integer',`Float',`Double',`Ratio
      a',`Complex a'
<ski> for other values of `f', a call to `foldr' can be incremental
<Hiro`> right  [16:50]
<ski> it is possible to define number types where a value can have more
      possibilities than a fully definite number, and the `undefined'

<nitrix> ski: Is it a better intuition to see types as being strict or not
         rather than functions?
<ski> the usual example would be `data Natural = Zero | Succ Natural', where
      `0' gets translated to `Zero',`3' to `Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))', and so
      on
<ski> nitrix : i'm not sure what it would mean for a type to be strict  [16:52]
<nitrix> ski: !Int.
<ski> nitrix : it so happens that the data constructors for `Ratio' and

<ski> @src Ratio
<lambdabot> data (Integral a) => Ratio a = !a :% !a
<ski> @src Complex
<lambdabot> data (RealFloat a) => Complex a = !a :+ !a
<kadoban> Hiro`: I think it's probably okay to think of functions as strict in
          some set of their arguments. (+) isn't one function though, it's
          many of them (depending on what instance of Num)  [16:53]
<Hiro`> kadoban: I'm trying to generalise though :)
<ski> nitrix : so, the notation `!Int' can't be understood on its own, but
      only in the context of a data type definition
<Hiro`> is there a general principle here?
<Hiro`> or is it just that some functions are strict and some are not?  [16:54]
<nitrix> ski: Isn't that enough? Pattern matching works on values and value
         constructors.
<ski> Hiro` : some functions are strict, some are not. depending on how they
      are defined, in general
<nitrix> Surely it can be generalized rather than just pointing at functiosn
         saying this or that is lazy or strict.
<ocharles_> codedmart: you pung?  [16:56]
<ski> the simplest definition of "strict" says that if `f :: T -> U', for any
      (possibly complex) type expressions `T' and `U', then `f' being strict
      means that if you evaluate `f' applied to a non-normally-terminating
      "value" (like `undefined'), you get a non-normally-terminating
      computation. symbolically : `f _|_ = _|_'
<ocharles_> I dunno why my IRC client on here doesn't highlight but my phone
            does :|
<codedmart> ocharles_ Thanks for pinging back. I think I figured it out
            though. Working with socket.io and am forking processes and doing
            some concurrent stuff. Was running into a wall, but I think I got
            it.  [16:57]
<ski> (by "non-normally-terminating" i mean that either it hangs in an endless
      loop, or that it aborts the computation in some abnormal way, like a
      pattern-match failure (including running out of guards to try), or a
      call to `error')
<Hiro`> ski: that's the definition I got from Bird and Wadler
<ocharles_> codedmart: oh, cool!
<ski> (in short, anything else than a normal return telling the caller what
      the main constructor of the answer is)
<ski> for practical informal use (at least), we extend this definition in
      various ways  [16:58]
<Hiro`> is there a good way to test whether a function is strict or lazy?
                                                                        [16:59]
<ski> one obvious extension is to say that if `f :: T -> U -> V' (really
      meaning `f :: T -> (U -> V)'), then saying that the binary function `f'
      is strict in its first argument means that `f _|_ x = _|_', for any `x',
      and similarly for other positions and arities
<ski> one other extension is that if e.g. `f :: (T,U) -> V', then we can say
      that `f' is strict in the first component of its input (a pair) iff `f .
      fst' is strict  [17:00]
<Hiro`> that makes sense
*** baweaver (~baweaver@173.230.196.25) has quit: Remote host closed the
    connection
<ski> in a similar fashion we can say that a function is strict in the first
      element of its input list, meaning that (in case the input list is
      non-empty), it will demand to look at the first element (and therefore
      itself fail to produce any answer in case that element isn't defined)
                                                                        [17:01]
<ski> "is there a good way to test whether a function is strict or lazy?" --
      you can try applying it to `undefined'. if you get some (partially or
      fully) defined answer, then it's not strict. otherwise, it could of
      course be that you'd have gotten that answer anyway. so perhaps better
      to try with something like `error "foo"', where you're reasonably sure
      that that error isn't raised by the code in question  [17:04]
<Hiro`> figuring out whether a function ever gets called does seem rather
        complicated  [17:05]

<rcyr> Could it be that harnessing the JavaScript ecosystem be the best way to
       use Haskell? :/  [18:54]
<Lokathor> rcyr, given the enormous build times on GHCJS compiles, i dunno
           about that.  [18:55]
<Lokathor> bitemyapp,
           https://lokathor.gitbooks.io/haskell-stuff/content/graphics/installing_sdl2.html
<rcyr> I'm really considering using node + ghcjs to do all kind of nice
       applications. Not sure if I'm just crazy
<Lokathor> also advice for gloss and gl (though gl needs no real advice, in
           fairness)
<Lokathor> rcyr, you mean to do server side applications?
*** lolcat (~user@unaffiliated/energy-/x-7653247) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners
<rcyr> Lokathor: Server and client-side.  [18:57]
<Lokathor> well, client side, ghcjs might or might not be the best plan.
           There's also Elm for example, which is haskell-like and a little
           easier to get in to perhaps (based on my difficulty getting ghcjs
           working)  [18:58]
*** achernyak (~artem@24-217-172-238.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) has quit: Ping

<Lokathor> for server side, there's not much reason to run node at all, just
           write a server-side haskell program
<rcyr> Client-side could be done with Electron... I mean, if you look at
       steam/blizzard's game launcher/atom/slack/etc, you can see that using
       chromium(HTML/CSS/Javascript) to define the client-side GUI is a good
*** vilasopher (~vilas@d47-69-127-238.try.wideopenwest.com) has joined channel
    #haskell-beginners  [18:59]
<rcyr> Lokathor: Node apps work everywhere, with haskell, you have to compile
       to your specific architecture.
<rcyr> Anyway :P I'm probably crazy, I'm just playing with that idea
<rcyr> I just see it as a way to "haskell all the things!"  [19:00]
<Lokathor> "have to"
<Lokathor> i dunno, stack is pretty good at about reproducable builds, if
           you're not using FFI  [19:01]
<rcyr> Right, love stack :)
<montanonic> rcyr: please consider Purescript (#purescript); it's almost
             exactly just Haskell on the client-side with easier JavaScript
             FFI and much nicer/smaller code gen that GHCJS can currently
             accomplish  [19:04]
<montanonic> rcyr: it's written in Haskell, as Elm is.
<montanonic> s/that GHCJS/than GHCJS
<Lokathor> montanonic, oh is purescript still going strong? I thought someone
           told me the other day it was being overtaken by ghcjs  [19:05]
<qu1j0t3> montanonic: was about to mention it myself. :)
<Lokathor> in fairness, i then tried ghcjs and about tore my eyes out waiting
           for each build
<rcyr> montanonic: I'm definitely going to look at it. I discarded Elm from my
       choices mainly because I don't see it as a general purpose programming
       language.
<rcyr> Lokathor: ghcjsi doesn't help?  [19:06]
<montanonic> Lokathor: I can't imagine it being overtaken by GHCJS anytime
             soon. I love that GHCJS is a thing, but PureScript is tailored to
             compile to JavaScript. Arrays are the default datatype. Writing
             FFI code is extremely straightforward if you know JavaScript.
<montanonic> GHCJS has Haskell library access, and you don't have to install
             different tooling. Those are the advantages it offers.   [19:07]
<Lokathor> rcyr, don't know what ghcjsi is. I'm guessing an interpreter?
<Lokathor> montanonic, getting ghcjs set up properly is what i'd call
           "different enough" tooling
<montanonic> I'd recommend reading through https://leanpub.com/purescript/read
                                                                        [19:08]
<Lokathor> i'll look into purescript if i need to write webpages
<montanonic> Lokathor: indeed; that's a good point
<rcyr> Lokathor: Yea, I think it's still experimental at this point :/
<Lokathor> right now i don't need to write any webpages :P
<montanonic> PureScript just came out with version 0.8 of their compiler, and
             the core team working on it is very consistently pushing updates
<Lokathor> the guy i was working with a webpage based haskell game kinda isn't
           working with me any more at the moment, or perhaps ever
<Lokathor> so i've moved on to other subjects
<montanonic> They are using it in production at their company so they have
             every reason to improve it too.   [19:09]
<Lokathor> my first two questions, which perhaps i should look up on the
           website, are: (1) does it run on ARM? (2) does it use stack or its
           own tool?
<montanonic> Lokathor: PureScript's Halogen library is really nice for writing
             web apps. Not sure at all about anything to do with games, but
             Apps, yes.  [19:10]
*** baweaver (~baweaver@173.230.196.25) has quit: Remote host closed the
    connection
<montanonic> Lokathor: what's ARM? And (2), it uses Pulp, which is on NPM and
             written in PureScript, and pulp is the tool that runs the
             compiler and interfaces with Bower, which manages their packages
                                                                        [19:11]
<Lokathor> ARM processor
<montanonic> Lokathor: so, in short, they use Bower
<Lokathor> wondering if i could run it on my rpi
<montanonic> PureScript is tied to the JavaScript ecosystem. Hence, they use
             JS tools.
<Lokathor> huh  [19:12]
<montanonic> Lokathor: I have no idea if it runs on ARM. PureScript is written
             in Haskell and uses npm/bower/gulp for tooling.
<montanonic> That's about all I can say.

             think its excellent. They also have a few features that are
             absolutely better than what Haskell currently has to offer. It's
             standard libraries also use a lot of Typeclasses and mimic
             ClassyPrelude more than Haskell's standard Prelude, which I also
             really like.

<montanonic> (not really at all)
<Lokathor> montanonic, well i was doing a website thing with a guy,
           https://cosban.net/spacefortress, but he kinda flipped on me a bit
           the other day and now the future of that project is very unknown
<montanonic> ClassyPrelude is much better though. I hate the existence of
             `fmap` for example. There should only be `map`. Traversable and
             Foldable also included by default in it.
<MarcelineVQ> "Stop trying to get me to use haskell!"  [19:17]
<Lokathor> you mean, ClassyPrelude changes Functor's fmap into being named map
           somehow?
<montanonic> Lokathor: yeah working with other people can be tough. I'm doing
             that now, but thankfully neither of them know web devel and I've
             been studying it for months. So I get to use all Haskell and
             PureScript and they can't complain.
<montanonic> Lokathor: I think it just defines `map` as `fmap`  [19:18]
<montanonic> Lokathor: It is a replacement for Prelude so there's no `map`
             lying around unless you import other data structures.
<Lokathor> well, i told him i wanted to work on a DB thing, and asked if there
           was a name/pass for me to use. he said he'd get back to me. hours
           later i show off my sqlite version I made in the mean time, and he
           gets upset that i "went ahread" without him.  [19:19]
<montanonic> You have to hide functions sometimes since it covers more ground
             but I much prefer the streamlined, batteries included Prelude to
             one where I have to import Foldable and Traversable in each file.

           your hands

<montanonic> Lokathor: Yeah, I don't know how I'd deal with coordinating with
             people on solving the same problems right now. Unless they were a

<Lokathor> getters to look inside a lambda?
<benzrf> how do i implement Foldable in terms of Traversable
<jle`> inside functions
<Lokathor> i was not aware of such getters
<jle`> benzrf: using Endo [a]
<benzrf> no i mean
<benzrf> i can figure out how to write it
<jle`> > view (to ($1)) (\x -> x)  [20:36]
<lambdabot>  1
<jle`> > view (to ($1)) (\x -> x + 10)
<lambdabot>  11
<benzrf> i just mean is there a preexisting implementation of foldr in terms
         of traverse, like how you can do instance Applicative where (<*>) =

<jle`> i guess `foldrOf traverse` from lens does it
<Lokathor> jle`, that looks like it's viewing the output?
<jle`> not sure if it's in base  [20:37]
<jle`> what do you mean by looking into a lambda, then?
<benzrf> :t foldrOf traverse
<lambdabot> Traversable t => (a -> r -> r) -> r -> t a -> r
<benzrf> cool.
<Lokathor> given some lambda of the form, (\x -> x + n), where n is some Num
           obviously, a way to tell what n is in a particular lambda of that
           form *without* actually applying the lambda to a value  [20:38]
<jle`> hm, how would having Traversable ((->) r) get you that?  [20:39]
<Lokathor> well, lens uses traversable and fmap and such to <magic here> look
           at values inside of things. So what else would the values "inside"
           a funciton yet to be applied be?  [20:40]
<jle`> they'd be the results  [20:41]
<jle`> the same interpretation as for the Functor instance
<Lokathor> that's less exciting
<jle`> and the Applicative instance, etc.
<Lokathor> very well
<Lokathor> so why can't you fold -> r
<Lokathor> isn't it kinda like a 1 element list?  [20:42]
<benzrf> got it
<jle`> ((->) r) is sort of like a vector
<Lokathor> could you fold it given a monoid instance?
<jle`> which a value at every r 'index'
<jle`> so ((->) Bool) can have a Traversable, Foldable instance
<benzrf> @let instance (Enum r, Bounded r) => Foldable ((->) r) where {foldr =
         foldrOf traverse}; instance (Enum r, Bounded r) => Traversable ((->)
         r) where sequenceA f = (\l r -> l !! fromEnum r) <$> traverse f

<benzrf> > toListOf traverse not  [20:43]
<lambdabot>  [True,False]
<jle`> yeah, sequence :: (r -> IO a) -> IO (r -> a)
<benzrf> > toListOf traverse (const True)
<lambdabot>      No instance for (Bounded b0) arising from a use of ‘traverse’
<lambdabot>      The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
<lambdabot>      Note: there are several potential instances:
<benzrf> D:
<jle`> it'd execute every possible IO action that the function would give,
       from every 'r' result

<Roelof_> Hello, I want to make a pattern matching where I test if two numbers
          are the same. So I did go list s1 s1  = list  . But now I see a
          conflicting error on this line. Schould I use guards or can this be
          done with pattern matching 
<ski> you can't (perhaps unfortunately) repeat the same variable and expect it
      to compare those positions for equality  [03:11]
<ski> guards is the usual way to do it
<ski> (you could do it with view patterns, but it's a bit silly)  [03:12]
<Roelof_> ski so this is a case I "must" use guards instead of pattern
          matching 
<ski> yes, unless you feel like both using a language extension, and being
      silly  [03:13]

<ski> (otoh Erlang would allow what you tried. even in cases where the
      variable to match with was bound in an outer scope. i believe it got

<ski> (that's a bit vague. i'm not sure whether you get the idea)

<Roelof_> I understand it , You want something like  1 ++ go <rest>

      (meaning roughly that their arguments aren't necessarily demanded just
      because you demand to know the "top shape" of the result)

<pjdelport> You can say: drop 1 $ dropWhile ( /= ' ') string
<Ankhers> If you change the order of string and list in your go function, you
          can use `drop 1 . dropWhile (/= ' ')`  [11:10]
<pjdelport> You can almost imagine the $ as casting two sets of parentheses on
            either side of it.
<pjdelport> So this: foo bar baz $ frob quux wooble
<pjdelport> reads as: (foo bar baz) (frob quux wooble)
<Roelof> oke, I thought I could use the . between them but then I saw type

<Roelof> so back to the drawing board :( 
<Ankhers> It is close.

<Roelof> just thinking how to solve this one. the drop x was not the right
         solution as it looks now   [11:16]
<Ankhers> It is a relatively simple fix. It happens because when you reach a

<Ankhers> exactly.

<MarcelineVQ> He had a specific example when he said that though it doesn't
              apply to everything.  [11:27]
<ski> well, sometimes using an accumulator (or some other alternative
      approach) is preferable
<ski> it depends on circumstances  [11:28]
<Roelof> I was asking this just of curisity and to learn. I noticed that

<ski> if you're condensing a large (incremental) data structure into a few
      "summary" bits of information (mostly bulky), then it doesn't
      necessarily help much to use direct recursion; you may be better off
      with an accumulator

          constraint". It'd be too weak to implement foldr without it.  [13:30]
<jedai> prati: I'm pretty sure you don't have to write foldMap, I think you
        can write foldr for your type and it will define foldMap for you
<kadoban> You can write foldr or foldMap, yeah. You can implement them in
          terms of each other, so there's default implementations that do so.
<prati> jedai I want to go other way around, implementing foldr is easy but
        foldMap is difficult to understand for me  [13:31]
